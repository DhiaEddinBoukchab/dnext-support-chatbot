The interface displays comprehensive supply and demand balance sheets for US agricultural commodities in tables showing key metrics: beginning stocks, production, imports, total supply, domestic use (broken down by feed, food/seed/industrial, exports), total use, and ending stocks. Both historical baseline data and forward-looking projections are presented with comparison views highlighting how current USDA forecasts differ from previous estimates, showing revisions in production, consumption, or stocks. Charts visualize the supply and demand balance over time, making it easy to identify whether stocks are building (surplus) or declining (deficit). Stocks-to-use ratios are calculated and displayed as a key indicator of market tightness, fundamental for understanding market fundamentals and price outlook.

BIOFUELS PRODUCTION
This dashboard analyzes USA biofuel production capacity in thousand M3 per year. Bar charts or line graphs display total production capacity for different biofuel types (Renewable Diesel, Methyl Ester, Ethanol fuel), tracking how capacity has expanded over multiple years. Regional breakdowns may show capacity concentration in specific states or regions (Midwest for ethanol, Gulf Coast for renewable diesel). The charts reveal rapid growth in renewable diesel capacity in recent years as this technology has gained market share. Capacity utilization rates may also be displayed, showing what percentage of installed capacity is actually being used. Users can filter by product type and year selection. This data is crucial for understanding biofuel supply potential and implications for feedstock demand (corn for ethanol, soybean oil and other vegetable oils for biodiesel and renewable diesel).

BIOFUELS SND (SUPPLY AND DEMAND)
This dashboard shows core supply and demand components (Consumption, Production, Net Imports) and stock levels of biofuels held in storage tanks across the country. Time-series charts display monthly or weekly production, consumption, imports/exports, and inventory levels for different biofuel types (Ethanol, Fame 0, Other Biofuel, Renewable Diesel). Line graphs track how these metrics evolve over time, revealing seasonal patterns in production and consumption. Production typically peaks during certain months based on feedstock availability and plant maintenance schedules, while consumption shows seasonal patterns related to gasoline demand and blending requirements. Inventory charts show stock levels building or declining, indicating market tightness. Net trade flows reveal whether the US is a net importer or exporter of biofuels. Users can filter by product type, items (Consumption, Inventory, Net Imports, Production), and multiple years. The ability to overlay multiple years allows identification of how supply and demand patterns are changing over time, particularly important as renewable diesel has emerged as a major new demand source for vegetable oils.

EXPORT SALES
This dashboard tracks and analyzes international sales and commitments of USA agricultural products across different countries and years.

SECTION 11: WEATHER

EXAMPLE: USA WEATHER

The weather dashboards provide clear, timely views of rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and NDVI across key regions to show how conditions may affect corn and other crops, supporting faster, better-informed decisions for planning, trading, and analysis.

FORECAST
This dashboard shows raw predicted values of weather variables (temperature or precipitation) for specific future periods. Line charts display forecasted daily minimum and maximum temperatures or precipitation amounts for the upcoming 1-2 weeks, with each point representing one day's forecast. Multiple forecast models may be shown (GFS, ECMWF, etc.) for comparison. Color coding highlights extreme values (very high/low temperatures, heavy precipitation events). For precipitation forecasts, bar charts show predicted rainfall amounts, making it easy to identify significant rain events that could affect fieldwork, crop development, or harvest operations. Example: A graph showing forecasted Minimum Temperature in degrees Celsius for each day from August 28 to September 11.

FORECAST VS AVERAGE
This dashboard shows the difference between predicted weather and what is historically normal for that location and date. Anomaly charts display whether predicted weather is above or below normal, with bar charts showing deviation from historical average—positive bars (above normal) typically in red/orange and negative bars (below normal) in blue. This normalized view accounts for normal seasonal changes, making it more useful than absolute values. The visualization quickly reveals whether upcoming weather is expected to be unusually warm, cool, wet, or dry compared to climatological norms. Example: An 11.20°C predicted temperature in Idaho is 2.03 degrees Celsius warmer than the long-term historical average for Idaho at this time of year. This is critical for agriculture because crop stress occurs when conditions deviate significantly from what crops are adapted to—large positive temperature anomalies during sensitive growth stages can reduce yields, while negative anomalies can delay development.

DAILY TEMPERATURE / PRECIPITATION
This dashboard displays actual observed daily temperature or precipitation data for specific countries or regions, including both current observations and historical records. Time-series charts show daily high and low temperatures or daily precipitation totals over recent weeks or months. Historical envelope charts show the normal range of temperatures (based on climatological data) with the current year's actual temperatures overlaid, making it easy to see when conditions are unusually warm or cold. For precipitation, cumulative precipitation charts show total rainfall since a key date (e.g., planting date) compared to normal, revealing whether the growing season is wetter or drier than average. Color-coded maps display geographic patterns, showing which regions are experiencing heat, cold, drought, or excess moisture. These observed weather dashboards provide the ground truth for assessing current crop conditions.

SOIL MOISTURE AND NDVI OVERVIEW
Soil moisture shows how much water is available to crops, making it a key yield indicator. Tracking it helps farmers and analysts plan irrigation, forecast yields, and anticipate market impacts. Low levels can signal drought stress before it's visible, while high levels can delay planting or cause disease. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) measures how green and healthy plants are using satellite imagery, widely used to track crop progress, compare regions, and spot problems early. Low NDVI values may signal stress, poor crop stands, or damage, while higher values indicate vigorous crop growth and healthy vegetation.

SOIL MOISTURE (COUNTRY LEVEL)
Country-level soil moisture dashboards display maps and charts showing soil moisture as a percentage of normal across an entire country. Color-coded maps use gradients from brown/red (dry) through yellow (near normal) to blue/green (wet) to instantly visualize geographic patterns of drought or excess moisture. Time-series charts show how national average soil moisture has evolved throughout the growing season compared to normal and previous years. Example: "The soil moisture in the top layer (0-7cm) was only 72.03% of the 5-year average for that same day, significantly drier than normal with less than three-quarters of typical moisture. The soil moisture is at 77.67% of the expected level for this time of year." This indicates moderate drought conditions that could stress crops. Multiple soil depth layers may be shown (topsoil 0-7cm for planting and emergence, deeper subsoil layers to sustain crops through grain fill).

NDVI (COUNTRY LEVEL)
Country-level NDVI dashboards display satellite-derived vegetation index data showing crop health and development across the nation. Maps use color gradients from brown/red (low NDVI, stressed or absent vegetation) through yellow to green (high NDVI, vigorous healthy crops). The visualization shows NDVI as a percentage of normal for the date, making it easy to identify regions where crops are healthier or more stressed than typical. Time-series charts track how national average NDVI progresses through the season, revealing whether crop development is ahead of or behind normal. The NDVI curve typically rises through vegetative growth, peaks around flowering, then declines as crops mature and senescence. Comparison with previous years helps identify whether the current crop is on track for normal, above-normal, or below-normal yields.

SOIL MOISTURE (STATE LEVEL)
State-level soil moisture dashboards provide granular geographic resolution, showing soil moisture conditions for individual states or provinces within a country. Maps display state-by-state patterns, revealing which states have adequate moisture and which face drought. The interface shows both point-in-time soil moisture (for a specific date) and period average (for a range of dates). Example: 72.89% indicates soil moisture on January 24, 2025 was at 72.89% of normal (significantly drier than average on that date), while 90.23% shows the average soil moisture for the entire period from January 1 to January 24, 2025 was at 90.23% of normal (the whole month was dry, but not as severely as the specific date). This dual view is important because a single dry day is less concerning than sustained dryness over weeks. Bar charts or tables rank states from driest to wettest, helping identify where drought is most severe. Historical comparison charts show whether current state soil moisture is better or worse than previous years. This state-level granularity is valuable because agricultural production is concentrated in specific states.

NDVI (STATE LEVEL)
State-level NDVI dashboards provide granular vegetation health data for individual states. Color-coded state maps instantly show which states have healthy crops (high NDVI, green) and which show signs of stress (low NDVI, brown/yellow). The visualization displays NDVI as a percentage of normal, normalized for the time of year and location. Rankings show which states have the highest and lowest NDVI relative to expectations. Time-series charts track individual state NDVI progression through the season, revealing whether specific states are experiencing delayed development, accelerated maturation (often due to heat stress), or normal progression. This state-level detail is crucial because yield impacts are not uniform across a country—one state might have excellent conditions while a neighboring state faces severe drought.

STATION DATA
Station data provides ground-truth measurements from physical weather stations (e.g., airports, farms) to verify the accuracy of forecast models against realized weather conditions. By comparing forecasts to actual station readings for metrics like precipitation and temperature, analysts can quantify model bias, refine future forecasts, and obtain precise real numbers needed for critical decisions in agriculture, logistics, and risk management. The dashboard displays actual measured weather data from individual weather stations distributed across agricultural regions. Tables show station-by-station readings of temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity. Maps plot station locations with symbols or colors indicating current conditions at each station. Time-series charts show recent history of observations at selected stations. This ground-truth data is essential for validating forecast accuracy and understanding actual conditions at specific locations. The dashboard allows comparison of forecast predictions against actual observations, revealing forecast errors. Station density maps show where observation coverage is good versus sparse.

MAP COMPARISON
This map visualizes 7-day or multi-day cumulative precipitation forecasts from weather models (e.g., NWS National Weather Service), showing predicted total rainfall across regions. Color-coded precipitation maps use scales ranging from white/light gray (little to no rain) through shades of green and blue to dark blue/purple (heavy rainfall). Users can quickly scan the map to identify which regions are expected to receive beneficial rainfall versus which areas will remain dry. Comparison mode displays multiple forecast models side-by-side to assess forecast agreement or divergence. When models agree, confidence is higher; when they diverge significantly, forecast uncertainty is elevated. These spatial visualizations are essential for understanding regional patterns in weather—rainfall is rarely uniform across large areas. The purpose is to provide a spatial overview for quickly identifying geographic patterns and disparities in expected rainfall, crucial for assessing broad-scale agricultural and flood risks.

TIME SERIES COMPARISON
This dashboard provides historical analysis of forecasted weather and its projected impact on agriculture, comparing predicted precipitation or temperature from multiple major weather models (ECMWF Ensemble, ECMWF Operational, GFS Ensemble, GFS Operational, NWS) made on a specific date for key growing months. Line charts show forecasts from each model plotted over time, with each model represented by a different colored line. The forecast is shown for a specific future period (e.g., growing season from May through September) as predicted on a specific date. This visualization reveals forecast agreement and divergence. When all model lines cluster together, there is high confidence; when lines diverge widely, uncertainty is high and outcomes could vary substantially. Ensemble forecasts may be displayed as shaded bands, with band width indicating forecast confidence. By visualizing the evolution of each model's precipitation forecast over the coming months, the graph highlights where projections diverged, converged, or shifted significantly, providing a clear view of forecast uncertainty and consensus throughout the growing season. This sophisticated visualization helps agricultural analysts understand not just what weather is expected, but how confident they should be in that expectation.

SECTION 12: FREIGHT MATRIX

This dashboard provides quick, at-a-glance comparison of freight costs for moving different types of commodities on various shipping routes using different vessel sizes. The comprehensive table displays shipping costs (freight rates) organized with origins (ports or regions) in rows and destinations in columns, with cells showing the freight rate in USD per metric ton. Color coding highlights competitive rates (green/low) versus expensive routes (red/high). 

Multiple vessel size categories may be shown (Panamax, Handymax, Supramax, Capesize) as larger vessels typically have lower per-ton costs but require larger cargo volumes and deeper port facilities. The matrix covers major agricultural trade routes including US Gulf to Asia, Brazil to China, Black Sea to Middle East/North Africa, and others. Time-based views show how freight rates have changed over recent weeks or months, revealing market tightness or softness in the shipping market. This freight data is critical for calculating delivered costs (origin price plus freight) and determining which supply origin is most economically competitive for a given destination.
