Hello Saber,
The dashboard has been fixed
One important point to note concerns the Seasonal Month filter:

*	
	When “Select All” is chosen, the dashboard displays the total values from the SND Main Tables.
*	
	When a specific month is selected, the dashboard shows only the evolution of the data within that month.

This explains the issue the client was experiencing, he was viewing the production evolution only for September. You can advise them to refer to the SND Main Tables page, where they can clearly see which selections to use and better understand the results.

@Lucas Rosa <mailto:lucas.rosa@dnext.io>  Is it normal for production to be split across several months? In other dashboards and products, production is usually assigned to a single month (for example, soybeans) and appears yearly rather than monthly.
Thanks,
Iheb
