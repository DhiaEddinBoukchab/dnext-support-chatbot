Downloaded new version = > cannot upload anymore. So we downloaded template and try again but u will see below, it is not working as well….

 



 

Many templates with the same names? Duplicates? Not clear?

 



 

 

Not uploading

 



 

Then tried again and again not working. 



 

 

Improvements:

Menu as well is not clear. Download and download data. 

I think upload and download data should be called upload template and download template…and then current download should be called download data
