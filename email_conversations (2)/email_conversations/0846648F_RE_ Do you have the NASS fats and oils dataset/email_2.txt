Hello Yiyuan,

 

Apologies for the delayed response.

 

I have shared the soybean oil to the platform.

 

Kindly find the link below : 

https://vags.dnext.io/datasets/vags-cb148487-4c48-11f0-8b51-02abcd39fb87/data-exploration

 

Regarding the other oils (rapeseed oil, corn oil, etc.), we currently don't have this data processed . However, we are working on it and will add it to the dataset as soon as it's ready.

 

We will inform you once the updates are complete.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Hi, 

 

Thanks. No, I am not looking for the WASDE or the PSD. I am looking at this, the NASS fats and oils report.

In your portal you have the soybean oil monthly production and stocks which comes from this report. If you could share that, and if you have the same for Rapeseed oil, corn oil etc (which are available in this report but only in the pdf form), that’d be great.

Dear Yiyuan,

Thank you for your request. We are in the process of sharing the data with you, but we’d like to ensure we are providing the correct dataset.

Is this the data you are looking for ? 
this is USDA Wasde report : 


 

And this is PSD : 


 

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Looking forward to your response

Hi Dnext support, 

 

Could you help me find the NASS fats and oils monthly report dataset? It’s not in the ready-download links.

 

Something along this line, should have all the production, and stocks for Soybean oil, rapeseed oil and corn oil etc. 

 

Thanks in advance!
