Hello Rafael , 

 

Apologies for the delayed response.

 

We are currently working on implementing the unit in the Tradematrix visual and API data, we will let you know once it’s implemented

 

For the ethanol Tradematrix it’s in Megaliters (1million liters).

As for the rest most of them are in 1000MT.

 

If you have doubts about a certain Tradematrix’s unit, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Please let us know if you have any more questions or concerns

 

Best regards,
