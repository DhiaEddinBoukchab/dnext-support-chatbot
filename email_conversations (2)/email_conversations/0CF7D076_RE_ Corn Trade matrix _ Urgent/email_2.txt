Hello Xavier,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

To re open the forecast in grid view , you just need to load it into the tradematrix 

 



 

Then drag it on the top layer

 



And after having made your edits you can  either:

*	Save your changes to the current version of the forecast, or
*	Publish them as a new version.

So to answer your question the edits can be made only in the tradematrix and then you can save your changes or publish them in a new version

 

I hope this helps clarify things for you.

 

I m also available for a quick call to assist you more if you like to .

Best regards,

Hello Saber, once we have created a forecast/scenario and saved it, how can we re-open it and still modify it as a grid/matrix ? I’m struggling to reopen my last grids, the Edit and Vizualise buttons are clickable but the both send to a page to change the name or renew the name of the forecast/dataset…

Thx a lot

Hello Xavier,

 

apologies for the inconvenience this may have caused our dev team are actively working on solving this issue. in the meantime, refreshing the page should solve the issue.

 

as for your second point you should find it in the following path in the folder just make sure to open the .xlsm file for the one with MACROS & VBA not the .xlsx (they have the same name so it can be a bit confusing )

" G&O\05- COUNTRY_ANALYSIS\ARGENTINA\SND\CRN_ARG_SND.xlsm"



 

Please let me know if you have any more inquiries or if you need further assistance.

Thanks Saber, ok clear

-Also just in case the other path seems to have a similar issues in tradematrix tab this morning still get the following: cf img below

 -btw what is the excel spreadsheet in the Sharepoint where we can do something equivalent to this grids/forecast and adding/deleting monthly exports vs ref(lineup) that pablo and you showed us yesterday? I don’t see it in the CRN ARG SND (only see the SND MTH or export pace but not the Matrix/grids with the delete/refresh VBA button) or WORLD CRN SND Package excel sheet either

thx
BR, Xavier

Hello Xavier,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

The path you mentioned seems correct , it appears to be a technical error on our end. Our development team has been notified and is currently investigating the issue.

Just to clarify, the correct way to create a Forecast is via the TradeMatrix:

1.	Click on the Forecast button.
2.	In the Forecast section, click Create.



 

3.	Specify the Name, Code (please use hyphens “-” instead of spaces or underscores for multi-word codes), and Color.
4.	Once created, click Load in the Forecast section, then check your forecast and move it from the left panel to the right.

 

 



 

After the forecast has been created, you can input data by directly editing the forecastable cells within the TradeMatrix.
You can then choose to either:

*	Save your changes to the current version of the forecast, or
*	Publish them as a new version.

(Please note that older versions cannot be modified , only the latest one can be edited.)

 



 

I hope this helps clarify the process. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance.

 

Best regards

Hola Pablo, Saber

can you remind us the path to get to the Matrix or maybe your cloud is down? 
I went to Tradematrix > corn line > visualize but got some issues and tried Tradematrix> Forecast> corn > Visualize and got the same error below when trying to create scenarios
