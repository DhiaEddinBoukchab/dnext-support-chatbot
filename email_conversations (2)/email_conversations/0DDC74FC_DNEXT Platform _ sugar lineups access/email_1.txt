Dear Maria,

 

I hope you're doing well.

 

This is Saber from the DNEXT Customer Support team. I’m reaching out to confirm that the sugar lineups for the following regions have been shared with your environment:

 

*	Thailand : https://raizen.dnext.io/datasets/raizen-268e936e-c459-11f0-9422-02abcd39fb87
*	India : https://raizen.dnext.io/datasets/raizen-ea8d470f-d4e4-11f0-9422-02abcd39fb87

 

To download the data, open the dataset page and click on the “Download” Button on the top right of the page.



 

Please let us know if you still need assistance with downloading the data. We're happy to schedule a call at your convenience to walk you through the process of accessing and downloading the data from the platform.

 

Additionally, I’d like to propose a demo session where we can guide you through the platform's main features and functionality. During this session, we can also introduce you to our Excel add-in, which allows you to fetch data directly from the platform into Excel. We’d be happy to assist you in setting it up as well.

Please let me know a suitable time for the demo session, and we’ll arrange everything for you.

 

Best regards,
