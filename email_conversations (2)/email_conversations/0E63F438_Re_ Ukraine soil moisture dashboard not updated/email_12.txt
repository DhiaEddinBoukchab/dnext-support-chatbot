For the dashboards, actually we changed just Ukraine. 
And I let @Martin Keller <mailto:martin.keller@dnext.io>  respond on this part: "what is the difference here? no crop mask? shouldnt we have the crop mask?"

Hello Pablo,
The dashboard has now been updated.
Please note that we have changed the table name in case you are using it in your code: ERA5_LAND_Ukraine_STATES_NOCROP_View.
