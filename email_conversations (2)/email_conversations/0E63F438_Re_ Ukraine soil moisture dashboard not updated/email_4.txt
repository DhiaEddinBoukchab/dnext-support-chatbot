what has changed is that we are not using a crop mask at all for the new data sets, as discussed in the Monday meetings.

Russian geographies (oblasts) are so large, especially in the north and east of the country, that using a crop mask is at least for now needed for producing values representative for agricultural activity, so for now we are sticking with the cropmasked time series there.
I am, however, producing non-cropmasked values for Russia as well to eventually replace all cropmasked values with non-cropmasked ones.

as discussed in the Monday meetings, we produce a new alternative data set that does not use a crop mask. 

This was done in order to avoid some of the issues with "missing" geographies raised by Bastien and Luca, which were due to the crop masks used flagging no crops in them.

The backfill is running this week at a pace of about 2 years per day (quite a bit of data to recompute), so in the absence of technical issues we'll have the full backfill without using crop masks by the weekend.

For the dashboards, actually we changed just Ukraine. 
And I let @Martin Keller <mailto:martin.keller@dnext.io>  respond on this part: "what is the difference here? no crop mask? shouldnt we have the crop mask?"

Hello Pablo,
The dashboard has now been updated.
Please note that we have changed the table name in case you are using it in your code: ERA5_LAND_Ukraine_STATES_NOCROP_View.
