Hi, 

 

Is this data being updated? Latest date I see available thru the API is 2025-01-21 but on the platform I see as late as 1/24. 

 

In addition could soybeans be added to this?

 

Thanks,

Hello Rafael,

Here is the code for the dataset containing data for Corn CNF to all destinations, FOB, as well as Freights:

Code: “zimb-a410fb85-d8ab-11ef-82fc-06cd53a4d901”

You will also receive automated emails notifying you each time the dataset is updated.

This will allow you to either download the file or refresh the API request.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out

Best regards,

Hi Rafael,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Yes, we can work on making the data available via the API.

Our goal is to make the full dataset accessible so you can explore the relationships you're interested in.

We’ll get back to you with the details once it’s ready.

In the meantime, let me know if there’s anything else I can assist with.

Best regards,

Hi,

I am not sure what years/destinations I’m interested in yet, would like the entire thing to play around with relationships if possible.

Do you think it could be made available via the API?

Even if history is hard to do, would appreciate current and going forward, or even just current data and I can start a time series on my side.

Thanks,

Dear Rafael,

I hope this email finds you well.

Unfortunately, the specific data you're looking for isn't directly available via our API.

This is because it results from calculations involving multiple datasets related to freights and currency conversion.

However, if you can let us know the years and destinations you’re interested in, we’d be happy to create an Excel file containing the relevant historical data for you.

Please feel free to share the specifics, and we’ll get started on compiling the information.

Looking forward to your reply.
