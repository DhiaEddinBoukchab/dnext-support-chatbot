================================================================================

Hello Team,
We have started working on the products correction. The process will be done in two steps:

1.	
	Step 1: Update products that don’t have a hierarchy and add the HS codes prepared by Pierre.
2.	
	Step 2: Add HS codes for products that already have an existing hierarchy (without changing their parents).

Please note that these changes may affect some tradeflows and dashboards,... . If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to me or Aya.
We aim to complete Step 1 by the end of this week.
Thanks,
Jebrane
