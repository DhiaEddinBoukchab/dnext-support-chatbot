The best would be Teams. Just checked and your organization has restricted access, so we need to find a way to set up a group chat. The chat of the meeting seems that is only active during the call.

@Saber Khalfallah <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> , can you check what we need to do to set up a group in teams if possible?

Are you all active on either, or would be interested in them? Assuming that is a part of our current subscription.
