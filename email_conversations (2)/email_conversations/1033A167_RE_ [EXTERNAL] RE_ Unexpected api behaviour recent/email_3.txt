Hello Charlie,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

I'm writing to update you on the issue with the API that you have reported.

 

Our Dev Team found that the wait_time in the script needs to be increased when you download large files. We recommend setting the wait time to 30, as this has resolved the issue for even our largest datasets.

 

Please try this fix and let me know if it resolves the issue. If you continue to have any problems, please don't hesitate to reach out.

 

Best regards,

Subject: Unexpected api behaviour recently

 

Hello, 

 

I have noticed that there are some troubles recently will calling data from the dnext api. Sometimes it fails, citing timeout errors (see below), and other times it runs as expected. This is code we have been using for some time and I suppose nothing major in the code has changed your end since it actually runs fine sometimes. However, it can take multiple attempts for the code to run properly, meaning that scheduled tasks often fail to complete.

 

The error usually looks like this:

 



 

If you need more details please let me know.

Thanks
