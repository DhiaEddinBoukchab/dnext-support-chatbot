Hello,

 

I would like to report a bug I encountered on the weather dashboard, (Europe > Temperature).

When using the graph section of the weather dashboard, if I accidentally click outside of a button area, all buttons in that section disappear. The only way to restore the buttons is to refresh the entire page.

 

Steps to Reproduce:

*	Navigate to the Europe weather dashboard
*	Go to precipitation

*	Go to the graph section
*	Click anywhere outside of the button boundaries within the graph area
*	Observe that the buttons disappear

 

Louis
