Subject: Looking for the updated Soybean Tradeflow matrix 
 
Hi Support team,

It seems the Oilseeds team has updated Brazil's July Soybean shipments, as seen in the SnD (first image below). However, the Tradeflow has not reflected this change (second image below) - I already clicked on Refresh data.

Could you help double check? I'm hoping to see the changes in not only Brazil but across all origins & destinations.

Thank you very much,
Oscar
