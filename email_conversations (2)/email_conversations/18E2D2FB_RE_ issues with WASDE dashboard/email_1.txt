Hello , 

 

There is an issue with the data. For example here , for Kazakhstan for the 2020/21 season from May to April the value according to the wasde report is 14.3 not 11.5 

 





 

This pattern is also present in other seasons so same issue for other years as well.

Subject: issues with WASDE dashboard 

 

Hi guys, we have strange numbers in this dashboard. i spoted this one but im afraid the issue might be affecting other selections as well.

can we check the numbers. you can focus on the selected seasons which are wrong...the changes in May clearly are confusing seasons and then coming back to the value at the end
