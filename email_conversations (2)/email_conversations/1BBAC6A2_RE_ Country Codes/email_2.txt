Hello Enea,

 

The reason you can not chose that in the value mapping step is because when the dataset was created the columns “Country Reporter” and “Country Partner” were made with a Filter on Value as “Country”,


 


meaning you can only map locations that have the type : “COUNTRY” the one you did not find have another type :”WORLD”
