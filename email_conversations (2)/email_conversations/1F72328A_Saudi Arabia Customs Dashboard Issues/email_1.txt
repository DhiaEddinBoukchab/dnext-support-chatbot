Hi, 

There is a unit problem between imports and exports, I think the exports are in kmt and the dashboard shows mt, the problem is at the source and not on our side

The source is shown to be Thailand where it should be Saudi Arabia:


Can you please fix as soon as possible and let us know 

Thanks
Asfoury
