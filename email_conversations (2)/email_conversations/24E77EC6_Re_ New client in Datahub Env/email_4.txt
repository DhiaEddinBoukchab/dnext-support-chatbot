Hello Sami,

 

Just to be sure , the resources we are sharing are Tradematrices & S&D Dashboards (the DNEXR one I assume ?) ? if he is going to be using the API he can not download the data from the dashboards , perhaps the datasets behind those dashboards ? 

 

Thanks in advance for your help.

 

Best regards,
