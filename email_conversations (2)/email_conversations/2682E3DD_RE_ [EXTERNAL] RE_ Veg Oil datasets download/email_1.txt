I have actually tried several times but don’t think I have ever had the download options…

Is there a way for me to extract/download the most recent vegoil world snd file or if you could send it over to me first while waiting for this to get resolved?

 

Thank you very much for your support.

Hello Stella

 

Thank you for reaching out ! 

 

To download the dataset you need to first click on the “visualize record” (the eye icon) button 


 

Then you will have this interface where you will see a “Download” Button at the top right of the screen

 



 

Then wait a bit and the dataset should be downloaded in your browser.

 

Please let us know how it goes , we would be happy to assist further if needed.

Hi,

 

Just hope to follow up on this – could you please check and verify if the download data option has been turned on for me? 

I don’t think I am capable of downloading anything at the moment from the Datasets tab.

Good afternoon,

 

Hope this email finds you well. As I was trying to download the veg oil SND datasets, I encountered an error which prevented me from downloading the data (as shown in the screenshot below). I was wondering if you could kindly take a look and see what the issue may be. 

 



 

Thanks,
