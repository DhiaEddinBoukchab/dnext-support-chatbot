Hello Stella

 

Thank you for reaching out ! 

 

To download the dataset you need to first click on the “visualize record” (the eye icon) button 


 

Then you will have this interface where you will see a “Download” Button at the top right of the screen

 



 

Then wait a bit and the dataset should be downloaded in your browser.

 

Please let us know how it goes , we would be happy to assist further if needed.

 

Best regards,

Hi,

 

Just hope to follow up on this – could you please check and verify if the download data option has been turned on for me? 

I don’t think I am capable of downloading anything at the moment from the Datasets tab.

 

Thanks,

Subject: Veg Oil datasets download

 

Good afternoon,

 

Hope this email finds you well. As I was trying to download the veg oil SND datasets, I encountered an error which prevented me from downloading the data (as shown in the screenshot below). I was wondering if you could kindly take a look and see what the issue may be. 

 



 

Thanks,
