Gday Guillaume, 

 

Thanks for below. 

 

Allow me to quote my legal department to avoid confusion:

 

QUOTE 

as a company policy, we do not agree to auto-renewals that cannot be cancelled other than on an annual basis.  Can we go back to them with the following options in order to reach agreement- 

 

1.	Have no auto-renewal - the contract is instead for a one -year term; the parties can enter into a new contract if we wish to renew the subscription; or
2.	The autorenewal clause remains, however we will provide a minimum of three months' notice of cancellation (rather than 30 days as we originally proposed).

 

If they can agree to one of the above options, then we can make exceptions to our policies in connection with the other non-favorable terms (foregoing the gross negligence standard on their product, jurisdiction, etc...)

Thank you Samy,

 

Here are my comments for your legal with revised doc attached. 

 

1.	Article 6. Your legal wants to add unless [..] are caused by Dnext’s gross negligence, willful misconduct etc.

We do not accept this change as it is too vague and open to interpretation. It will mean that you could go after us for any error we commit raising that it is due to gross negligence. Risk is too high for us. We make forecasts that are several months away and we cannot guarantee accuracy as you know. Obviously, we give our best effort as if we do not, you do not renew, and we are out of business.  This is our risk and happy to take it but do not want take the risk to be sued because our forecast was not accurate. 

 

2.	Article 6.1: addition of the word solely is fine
3.	30 days instead of 15 days is ok as well
4.	Article 9.4 amendments are ok. 
5.	Governing law: We prefer to keep Switzerland. We are a small company and will be hard to defend ourselves. Swiss is a very international with a developed law system, so you are very safe.
6.	Number of users: we work per PM with hedge fund. So, your desk and replacement but we do not provide service to several PM. So I have only partly accepted changes but want to make sure wording is clear on this point. 
7.	Planning & duration: ok for 30 days instead of 3 months for notice but no for 30 days cancellation after 12-month term. Our subscriptions are annual.

 

 

Thank you. We look forward to working together soon. Any questions, do not hesitate.

Best Regards,

Dear Samy and Alessandra,

 

It was a pleasure to talk to you today. As discussed, I am putting different options we have so you can see which one is most adapted for you. 

Let me know if one of them is adapted with what you want/need for sugar.  

1.	Platform + weekly reports but no consulting : CHF 50k/year.
2.	Platform + weekly reports with consulting: CHF 75k/year.

 

Consulting includes: 

a.	Access to 2 analysts on daily basis (email exchanges, chats), 
b.	Biweekly calls to review SND

What are the benefits of working with DNEXT?

a.   You can automatically collect information from websites, emails, or other formats. Data will be ingested, structured, and stored in a database for reuse, API access. This includes prices, economics, weather, statistics, port lineups or any information that could be of use.

b.   The network we have built and continue to build will allow your traders to have access to market research as if they were sitting in a large, physical trading house with a global reach but without the overheads and assets to manage.

c.   You will have access to an interactive platform with all the information you need. Your team can focus on analysis and risk management and less on data crunching.

d.   You will have access to a team of experienced trade analysts covering most agriculture commodities and benefiting from the synergies among them.  

 

Let me know if you need anything or if you have any questions.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,

Guillaume
