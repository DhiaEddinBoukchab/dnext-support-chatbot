	Hi Saber,

	No problem. Sara and I are both free and this works London time. 

	Annie is normally in early in Houston, but defer to her to confirm if this time works for her on that day, when she gets online later.

	Dear Fiona, Annie, and Sara,

	 

	I hope this message finds you well.

	 

	I would like to kindly request if we could reschedule the tutorial originally planned for Friday, 30th May, to 1:30 PM London time / 7:30 AM Houston time. This adjustment would allow a colleague who is crucial to the session to join us, which I believe will enhance the overall discussion.

	 

	Please let me know if this new time works for you. Once confirmed, I will send an updated calendar invitation.

	 

	Thank you very much for your understanding and flexibility. I look forward to our upcoming session.

	Hi Saber and team,

	 

	Nice to e-meet you. Believe it is just myself, Annie and Sara across the analyst pool who responded when I asked who wanted a tutorial. Would 30mins be enough time? If so could we please do one of these slots:

	1.        Thurs 29 May @ 130pm LON / 730am HOU

	2.        Fri 30 May @ 130pm LON / 730am HOU …. Or 200pm LON / 800am HOU … or 230pm LON / 830am HOU

	 

	As soon as we hear from you either feel free to send an invite directly, or I can set a hold in our diaries to make sure the time doesn’t get double booked!

	 

	Thanks, and we look forward to learning more,
