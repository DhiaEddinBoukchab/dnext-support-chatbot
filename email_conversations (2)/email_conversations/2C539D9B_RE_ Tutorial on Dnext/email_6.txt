Hi Saber and team,

 

Nice to e-meet you. Believe it is just myself, Annie and Sara across the analyst pool who responded when I asked who wanted a tutorial. Would 30mins be enough time? If so could we please do one of these slots:

*         Thurs 29 May @ 130pm LON / 730am HOU

*         Fri 30 May @ 130pm LON / 730am HOU …. Or 200pm LON / 800am HOU … or 230pm LON / 830am HOU

 

As soon as we hear from you either feel free to send an invite directly, or I can set a hold in our diaries to make sure the time doesn’t get double booked!

 

Thanks, and we look forward to learning more,

Fiona
