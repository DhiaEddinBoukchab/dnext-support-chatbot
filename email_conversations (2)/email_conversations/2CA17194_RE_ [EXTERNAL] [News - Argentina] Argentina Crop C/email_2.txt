Hello Rafael,

I hope this email finds you well

we would like to take this opportunity to explain the process involved in handling the Bolsa report.

First, the Bolsa report is often published with a delay, and not all our data comes directly from it. 

 

We also scrape additional data from various Bolsa files, which themselves may be updated late. 

 

Processing multiple sources and formats(the report contains multiple images as a data inputs, which take more time to process), updating the datasets, and the dashboard all takes additional time.

After that, we work on summarizing the report, which involves translation to extract key insights. 

This step requires careful review to ensure accuracy and seamless translation. 

Additionally, we incorporate our own analysis to enhance the report’s value. 

Once all of this is completed, we attach the relevant charts from the dashboard.

If you think it would be beneficial, we can send you the updated charts as soon as they are available and follow up with the comments afterward.

Also, we are actively working on solutions to streamline the process and reduce the time required to send the email.

 

Best regards,

Corn:

*                  Our corn crop estimates are stable at 48 MMT .

*                  The Bolsa de Cereales  estimates are stable at 49 MMT.

*                  The Rosario Grain Exchange estimates are stable at 48 MMT.

 

*                  Planting Progress: The current Corn planting cycle is nearing completion, with 99.3% of the projected 6.6 MHa already planted, with only the last fields in the NEA region remaining to be planted.

*                  Crop Progress:

-  The Vegetative stage is at 96%, +2 pp vs last week and +2.84 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Tasseling stage is at 65%, +11 pp vs last week and +9.90 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Silking stage is at 51%, +6 pp vs last week and +8.64 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Doughing stage is at 33%, +4 pp vs last week and +10.8 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Maturing stage is at 12%, +5pp vs last week and +6.54 pp vs 5 years average.

 

*	Impact of Recent Rainfall:

- The rainfall concentrated in the most drought-affected areas of the summer.

- However, early-planted Corn has not fully recovered due to its advanced growth stage, though some benefit may still be observed during grain filling.

- Late-planted corn in southern Córdoba and western Buenos Aires, where 50-60% of the area is entering its critical period, has seen a 21 p.p. increase in Adequate/Optimal water conditions, which should improve crop conditions in the coming days.

 

*                  Water and Crop conditions:

- Overall, The Adequate/Optimal water condition has Increased by 6 pp, from 57% to 63%

- 74% of the crop is rated in Normal to Excellent condition, -4 pp vs last week

 

*                  Harvest and Production Outlook:

-  The first harvested fields in the Central-East of Entre Ríos have reported good results.

- Production projections remain unchanged at 49 MMT.

 

Soybeans: 

*                  We have adjusted our soybean crop estimate downward this week, reducing it from 50 MMT  to 47.5 MMT .

*                  The Bolsa de Cereales soybean's estimates are stable at 49.6 MMT.

 

*                  Crop Progress:

-  The Vegetative stage is at 98.7 %, +1.7 pp vs last week and +2.7 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Flowering stage is at 71.5%, +8.5 pp vs last week and +8.75 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Blooming stage is at 39.3%, +10.3 pp vs last week and +10.8 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Filling stage is at 6.3%, +5.3pp vs last week and +1 pp vs 5 years average.

 

*	Current Crop Condition: 68% of the planted soybean area is in Normal/Excellent condition, showing a weekly decline of 4 pp

 

*                  Impact of Recent Rainfall:

- Widespread rainfall with significant accumulations in the central region has led to a 6 p.p. increase in Adequate/Optimal water conditions, now covering 64% of the crop.

- These timely rains benefit 39% of the area currently in critical yield-defining stages, mainly in the central agricultural region.

 

*                  Yield and Production Outlook:

- First-crop soybeans will see reduced yield losses thanks to the improved water availability.

- Second-crop soybeans will also benefit, as the rainfall helps alleviate water stress before entering critical growth stages.

 

February and early March weather plays a crucial role for corn and soybean crops.
