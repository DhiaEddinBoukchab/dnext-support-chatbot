Corn:

*                     Our corn crop estimates are stable at 48 MMT .

*                     The Bolsa de Cereales  estimates are stable at 49 MMT.

*                     The Rosario Grain Exchange estimates are stable at 48 MMT.

 

*                     Planting Progress: The current Corn planting cycle is nearing completion, with 99.3% of the projected 6.6 MHa already planted, with only the last fields in the NEA region remaining to be planted.

*                     Crop Progress:

-  The Vegetative stage is at 96%, +2 pp vs last week and +2.84 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Tasseling stage is at 65%, +11 pp vs last week and +9.90 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Silking stage is at 51%, +6 pp vs last week and +8.64 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Doughing stage is at 33%, +4 pp vs last week and +10.8 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Maturing stage is at 12%, +5pp vs last week and +6.54 pp vs 5 years average.

 

*	Impact of Recent Rainfall:

- The rainfall concentrated in the most drought-affected areas of the summer.

- However, early-planted Corn has not fully recovered due to its advanced growth stage, though some benefit may still be observed during grain filling.

- Late-planted corn in southern Córdoba and western Buenos Aires, where 50-60% of the area is entering its critical period, has seen a 21 p.p. increase in Adequate/Optimal water conditions, which should improve crop conditions in the coming days.

 

*                     Water and Crop conditions:

- Overall, The Adequate/Optimal water condition has Increased by 6 pp, from 57% to 63%

- 74% of the crop is rated in Normal to Excellent condition, -4 pp vs last week

 

*                     Harvest and Production Outlook:

-  The first harvested fields in the Central-East of Entre Ríos have reported good results.

- Production projections remain unchanged at 49 MMT.

 

Soybeans: 

*                     We have adjusted our soybean crop estimate downward this week, reducing it from 50 MMT  to 47.5 MMT .

*                     The Bolsa de Cereales soybean's estimates are stable at 49.6 MMT.

 

*                     Crop Progress:

-  The Vegetative stage is at 98.7 %, +1.7 pp vs last week and +2.7 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Flowering stage is at 71.5%, +8.5 pp vs last week and +8.75 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Blooming stage is at 39.3%, +10.3 pp vs last week and +10.8 pp vs 5 years average.

- The Filling stage is at 6.3%, +5.3pp vs last week and +1 pp vs 5 years average.

 

*	Current Crop Condition: 68% of the planted soybean area is in Normal/Excellent condition, showing a weekly decline of 4 pp

 

*                     Impact of Recent Rainfall:

- Widespread rainfall with significant accumulations in the central region has led to a 6 p.p. increase in Adequate/Optimal water conditions, now covering 64% of the crop.

- These timely rains benefit 39% of the area currently in critical yield-defining stages, mainly in the central agricultural region.

 

*                     Yield and Production Outlook:

- First-crop soybeans will see reduced yield losses thanks to the improved water availability.

- Second-crop soybeans will also benefit, as the rainfall helps alleviate water stress before entering critical growth stages.

 

February and early March weather plays a crucial role for corn and soybean crops.
