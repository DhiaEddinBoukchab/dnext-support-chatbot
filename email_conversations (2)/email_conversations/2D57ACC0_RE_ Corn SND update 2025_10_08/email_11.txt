Hi Raymond,

Extract from a broker report on June 20th 2023



 

Data is correct. I also was wondering if there was a mistake but found back the original reports. 

Do you need something else? All the data is in your Amaggi.dnext.io platform. I am adding support who can help in case you do not know how to access it.
