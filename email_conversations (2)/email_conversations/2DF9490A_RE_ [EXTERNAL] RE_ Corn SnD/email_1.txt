Hi Saber,

 

Can you please confirm if the code for the corn SnD dataset that I’m using is correct?

 

code = 'thul-6739954d-a4f8-4436-a7bc-f57bf3b79f20'

 

I just downloaded the latest data (Mat 5th ) where I see US FSI use at 6.9 bln bsl (see excel snapshot below with the cals) vs the report shared overnight where FSI use is reported at 6.873 bln bsl.

 

Latest from DB: Sep24 to Aug25
