Hi Rifa and team,

 

@Neil Smaldon <mailto:nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com>  and I tried to reset our initial passwords - but could not, because the verification email never came to our inboxes (screenshot below).

 

On our side, we have checked our Spam/Junk folders and have our IT team (@Don Amerman <mailto:Don@valentassetmgmt.com> ) check our company email server - but no verification email came (since last Thursday May 22).

 

Could you check on your side whether the codes have been sent?

 



 

Thank you very much,

Oscar
