Hi Saber

I hope all is well.

Could I please get your assistance.

In our company Box drive, the latest SND datasets have not been uploaded this week . They are usually uploaded when the weekly global SND report are sent out and ahead of our Thursday MS Teams call with DNEXT.

I only joined Polar Star in the last few months, and want to check if the SND data is being uploaded to the drive by DNEXT. If so, is it done through an automated process?

Best,
