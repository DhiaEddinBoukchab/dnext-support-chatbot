Subject: Request to Align Column Order for Europe Datasets (Sugar & Dairy) – Data Prep Compatibility

================================================================================

Dear Support Team,
I hope you're doing well.
I would like to request the creation of a ticket for the dev team to address an issue concerning the column order in the Europe Customs datasets, specifically the Sugar and Dairy datasets.
As shown in the attached screenshots:


*	
	(Sugar dataset new column order : Extra Publication Date - > Intra Publication Date -> Value Unit Multiplier -> Currency -> Value)



*	
	(Grains and Oilseeds dataset new column order : Value -> Currency -> Value Unit Multiplier -> Intra Publication Date -> Extra Publication Date)



*	
	Current SQL-based data preparation)

We recently added new columns across all Europe datasets. However, while the same new columns were included, they were not added in the same order across datasets. This creates a mismatch when running the data_prep and forces us to manually list each column instead of using SELECT * like we usually do! 
Please update the column order in the following datasets so that they match the structure of the rest:

*	
	Sugar
*	
	Dairy

Please let me know if you need any further information or clarification.
Regards,
Skander
