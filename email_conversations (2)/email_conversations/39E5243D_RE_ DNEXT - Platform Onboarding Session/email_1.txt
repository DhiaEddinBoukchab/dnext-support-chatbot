Hello!


Thanks for your email.


Seems like Wednesday 29 Oct at 11 AM GVA time would be the best alternative. Could you kindly book it? You can invite all the people with Neste access, of course for some people the platform is more relevant vs. for some others.

 

Kind regards,

	Hi Saber,

	
	Antoine is out of office most of this week, and on top of that it would be nice to get a couple of other colleagues (who will be heavy users of the platform) also to join the session, which doesn't happen within such a short timeframe.

	 

	Could you kindly propose slots for the beginning of next week, and we will align internally regarding schedules?

	 

	Kind regards,

	Tuukka
