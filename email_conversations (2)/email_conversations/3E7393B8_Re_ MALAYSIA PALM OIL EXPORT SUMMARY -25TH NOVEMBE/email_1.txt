Hi Bastien,
Malaysia is up to date we can't make an automated refresh because it's consuming a shared dataset
@Jebrane Ben Salem <mailto:jebrane.bensalem@dnext.io>  Can you make a scheduled refresh on Power BI service every 5 days?
Thanks

Hello Bastien,

 

This file looks like a summary of Lineups.

Should we create a dataset for it ?

If yes, should we put all the grades, destinations and load ports as columns and the dates as rows?

 

Best Regards,
