Hello Bastien ,

 

The problem seems to be that upon hovering on the dashboards module they should be seeing “Business Categories” that are related to the dashboard that are shared in their environment.

but they are only seeing “Sugar” even if they do not have access to any of its dashboards.

a ticket has been created for the dev team for further investigation. You can follow up on the ticket in the link below:
