Hi guys, not sure who should be doing this but putting all in copy so you are aware.

 

is it possible to make this changes before today 10pm? sorry for so short notice.

 

 

Changes to the BF environment:

 

1.	change the name of "Crop Statistics" to "EuroStats Estimates"



 

2.	TAXUD Dashboard should be in the "Inspections" section



 

 

 

3.	Add Black sea dashboards:

list is the following.

 

 

4.	Is it possible to delete the category "EU Black Fryers"? it was created for the Dnexr environment but here is redundant as it contains dashboards that are already present inside other categories.



 

 

5.	Inside the "Meat" category we have the "Production" Dasboard. can we change the name to "Meat Production". otherwise it can be confusing as we have also crop production.



 

 

 

 

6.	Change the name of the "Meat" Category to "Feed & Livestock"
