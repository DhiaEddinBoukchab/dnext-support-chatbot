Hi guys,

 

Can you please share all the customs dataset we have with ETG as soon as possible ?

They have the oilseeds scope.

Please also share the Customs Calendar dashboard, as well as the “Price Scenario” dashboard within “Supply and Demand / DNEXR / Price Scenario”.

 

Thanks,

 

Bastien
