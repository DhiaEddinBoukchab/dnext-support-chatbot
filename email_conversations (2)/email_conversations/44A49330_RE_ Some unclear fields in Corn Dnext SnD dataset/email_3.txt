Subject: Some unclear fields in Corn Dnext SnD dataset

Hello Guillaume/Pablo, 

 

I am looking through the Corn SND dataset (thul-c4ffcc58-c9b0-4935-a0c8-b93f28d7d674) and notice some fields that do not make sense to me, so just hoping you can clarify.

 

I am not clear on what the following items with Item_MappedName ‘Protein Use’, ‘use_flour’ and ‘Not_Available’ (which are all values linked to Ukraine) are representing. Not_Available is a nan Item but does have values. ‘use_flour’ seems like it should be for wheat? ‘Protein_Use’, what does this represent, some aggregation? 

 

Thanks in advance for clarifying!
