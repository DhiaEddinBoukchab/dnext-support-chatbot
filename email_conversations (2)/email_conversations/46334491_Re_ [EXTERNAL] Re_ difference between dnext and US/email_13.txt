Hi Pablo, 

 

No rush, if it’s ready by this week would already be good. 

 

I just want to be able to align to USDA to be able to track evolution of changes vs WASDE on apples to apples for total wheat. Then can drill into by-class breakdown. 

 

Best, 

Rafael

Hi Raphael,  I think the best will be that i take the dataset and use it to reproduce our snd. That way u will be able to track the snd by class and break it down.

 

let me see if i can get this done today i send it to you.

 

 

Regards,

Pablo

Is soft wheat all of them except  durum?

 

It would be good if there was an option on the platform or in the API to have the same as the wasde, would make it much easier to do comparisons.

 

Best,

Hi,

 

Why is there such a big difference between dnext estimates and USDA balance sheet for the US?

 



 

 

What I’m seeing from the power point does not line up with what’s on the platform:


 

Thanks,
