Is soft wheat all of them except  durum? 

 

It would be good if there was an option on the platform or in the API to have the same as the wasde, would make it much easier to do comparisons. 

 

Best,

Hi, 

 

Why is there such a big difference between dnext estimates and USDA balance sheet for the US?

 



 

 

What I’m seeing from the power point does not line up with what’s on the platform: 


 

Thanks,
