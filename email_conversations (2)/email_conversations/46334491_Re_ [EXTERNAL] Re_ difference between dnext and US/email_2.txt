So just looking at this list (products returned by the API):

0           WSWHT                Winter Wheat

4             SWW           Soft White Winter

18           SWHT                  Soft wheat

19           DWHT                 Durum Wheat

20           WWWH          White Winter Wheat

21   DWHT_BYPDWHT  Durum Wheat and ByProducts

23            HRS             Hard Red Spring

31          SWHTF            Soft Wheat Flour

33       WHT_PLTS              wheat pellets

141         SSWHT                Spring Wheat

144           SWS           Soft White Spring

 

I see HRW, SRW, DWHT and HRS however not seeing SW.

 

In addition, I could I add DWHT + SWHT for all wheat (same as USDA)?

 

Thanks,

Hi Rafael maybe we cna have a call so i explain.

 

 

int he file in the "SND_Y" tab, you have all the SND´s

 

basically All Wheat = SOFT WHEAT + DURUM

 

and SOFT WHEAT = HRW + SRW + HRS + SW

 

let me know if u want we can have a quick call when it´s convenient for you.

I’m sorry I don’t understand the file. If it’s in there I couldn’t find it.

 

I’m looking for wheat class mapping not item mapping. Like what dnext classes do I sum up to get USDA all wheat balance sheet.  For the items (planted, yield, production) it’s more straight forward, I don’t need that mapping.

this code has our data by class. 

adn the excel file i send you is an example of which variables to take for each class to replicate the snd using the API data.

Hi Pablo,

 

No rush, if it’s ready by this week would already be good.

 

I just want to be able to align to USDA to be able to track evolution of changes vs WASDE on apples to apples for total wheat. Then can drill into by-class breakdown.

Hi Raphael,  I think the best will be that i take the dataset and use it to reproduce our snd. That way u will be able to track the snd by class and break it down.

 

let me see if i can get this done today i send it to you.

Is soft wheat all of them except  durum?

 

It would be good if there was an option on the platform or in the API to have the same as the wasde, would make it much easier to do comparisons.
