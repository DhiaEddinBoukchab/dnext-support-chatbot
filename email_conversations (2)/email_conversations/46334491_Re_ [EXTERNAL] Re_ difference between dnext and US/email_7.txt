this code has our data by class. 

adn the excel file i send you is an example of which variables to take for each class to replicate the snd using the API data.

Sorry, still a bit confused.

 

All I’m looking for is what data to pull from API and what classes to combine in order to align dnext balance sheet with what USDA publishes for all wheat.

Hi Raphael, see a file which is taking the data from  our database. You will need to change the code or use as reference.

 

Let me know if this helps.

Hi Pablo,

 

No rush, if it’s ready by this week would already be good.

 

I just want to be able to align to USDA to be able to track evolution of changes vs WASDE on apples to apples for total wheat. Then can drill into by-class breakdown.

 

Best,

Hi Raphael,  I think the best will be that i take the dataset and use it to reproduce our snd. That way u will be able to track the snd by class and break it down.

 

let me see if i can get this done today i send it to you.

Is soft wheat all of them except  durum?

 

It would be good if there was an option on the platform or in the API to have the same as the wasde, would make it much easier to do comparisons.

Hi,

 

Why is there such a big difference between dnext estimates and USDA balance sheet for the US?

 



 

 

What I’m seeing from the power point does not line up with what’s on the platform:
