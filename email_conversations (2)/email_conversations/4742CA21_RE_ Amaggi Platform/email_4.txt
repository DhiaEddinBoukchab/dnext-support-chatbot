Hello Lucas,

 

Amaggi don’t have cotton as a product in their contract that’s why they do not see it in their dashboards.

 

@Guillaume Goudy <mailto:guillaume.goudy@dnext.io>  should i add cotton to them considering its not in the product list in their contract form ?

 

Best regards,

Hello All, how are you?

 

Is it possible to give permission for Amaggi over the USDA cotton crop numbers and Stats? They are complaining about it and it will be a good improvement for them.
