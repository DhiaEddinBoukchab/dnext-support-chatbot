Dear Roberto,

 

I’m following up regarding the dashboard issue. 

 

We are actively investigating the discrepancy in the values. 

 

While it’s proving to be a more complex issue than initially anticipated, we are working to identify the root cause, and this may take some time.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding. 

 

We’ll keep you updated as we make progress.

Hi Saber,

 

Hope this email finds you well.

 

I noticed that there’s an error in the wasde database, as the USA cotton values for recent years show no exports while the production values look inflated, as if they are being double counted.

There’s also no data for planted nor harvested estimates in recent years, so something is being incorrectly saved.

 

Could you pls look into this?

 

Many thanks
