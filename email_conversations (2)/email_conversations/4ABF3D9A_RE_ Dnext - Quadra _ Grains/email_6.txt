Thank you, Nick for reaching out. I am adding support who will help you. Indeed, you should have.

Happy holiday season to you and your team,

Hi Guillaume

 

Thanks. Let me discuss internally and come back to you. 

 

One other question, just trying to look at some temp charts on the platform and I notice that in places like Romania we don’t have access because it only gives a corn option (to which we are currently not subscribers). However given these origins also produce oilseeds I would have thought it would be relevant for our current subscription?

Hello Nick,

 

Following our conversation yesterday, see below the last communication on pricing. Pricing remains the same. Today, you pay 60k for vegoils/oilseeds. If you add grains, it moves to 100k or +40k for grains. 

Let me know if you have any questions or comments. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Guillaume,

 

Thanks for the below we will for sure go ahead with Option 3 (oilseeds/vegoil) - we are considering to switch to option 1 and include grains.

To make this call could we pls schedule another presentation focused on the grain/corn and weather part for next week to show what you provide to a wider grain audience?

 

Thanks a lot

Dear Nick and Felix,

 

Thank you for your time last Friday. As discussed, I am putting different options so you can see which one is most adapted for you and your team.

All the numbers are per year and in CHF :

Regarding the G&O complex :

Option 1 : Corn/Wheat + Oilseeds/Vegoils // reports + platform = 100k

Option 2 : Corn/Wheat + Oilseeds/Vegoils // reports + platform + consulting = 150k

Option 3 : Oilseeds + Vegoils // reports + platform = 60k

Option 4 : Oilseeds + Vegoils // reports + platform + consulting = 100k

We did not talk about sugar but let us know if you are interested as well.

 

Consulting includes:

1.            Access to 4 analysts on daily basis (phone call, chats), covering crops, oilseeds, corn and sugar.

2.            Biweekly calls to review SND, biweekly SND update+ppt for corn, soy, and vegoils / Biweekly calls to review SND, weekly update+ppt in case of sugar.

3.            Network benefit: we already have 25 clients across the supply chain (from farmers to crusher, biofuel producers but also Consumer Packaged Goods company and across all geographies).

4.            We also help our clients when they want/need our assistance with their own research or data such as crop tour, tailor made dashboards, training of analyst, scraping of proprietary data/automation. These are just examples and the list is non-exhaustive.

 

What are the benefits of working with DNEXT:

a.       You can automatically collect information from websites, emails, or other formats. Data will be ingested, structured and stored in a database for reuse; This includes prices, economics, weather, statistics, port lineups or any information that could be of use.

b.       The network we have built and continue to build will allow your traders to have access to market research as if they were sitting in a large, physical trading house with a global reach but without the overheads and assets to manage.

c.       You will have access to an interactive platform with all the information you need. Your team can focus on analysis and risk management and less on data crunching.

d.      You will have the possibility to build a long-term hedge for QUADRA and be at the forefront in data analytics. This will guarantee your system and data will remain in place despite possible employee changes. Data is also secured and can be monitored by your management. 

Thank you and look forward to hearing from you soon. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email or mobile: +41798517459.

Best Regards,

Guillaume Goudy
