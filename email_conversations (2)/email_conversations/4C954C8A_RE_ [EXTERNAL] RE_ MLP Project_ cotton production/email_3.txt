Hi Saber, 

 

Hope that you’re doing well. I tested the new dataset (thul-55b2939d-9504-11f0-9422-02abcd39fb87) and it’s looking great.

 

I noticed though that new data is now being updated, as the report of Sep 18 is not included. Can we add as recurring task a weekly update?

 

Thanks and regards.
