Hi Jebrane,

 

No idea who is responsible for this dashboard. Is it possible to make the default value for the ETS reporter slicer all the way to the right, so we show the entire spectrum of dates.

If we can only setup a value, and it wont re-adapt when new data comes in, is it possible to just change it to the latest date possible please i.e. 13th Nov

Thanks
