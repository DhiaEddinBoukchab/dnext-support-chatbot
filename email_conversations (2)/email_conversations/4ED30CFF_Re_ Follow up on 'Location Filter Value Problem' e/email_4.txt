Hello Nicolas,
Still facing the same problem, when I change to REGION the NATIONAL_REGION are not appearing and it goes both ways, and I have both hierarchies in my dataset, is there a way to disable the filtering ?
Tried to leave it empty and save on that configuration but it gets back to the default configuration (as shown in screenshot 2 and 3)
I checked another dataset where I have the same methodology (multiple hierarchies) and it seems that the filter value is not applied (screenshot 4)

Hello,

Issue was elsewhere as you supposed. I've created a ticket for this: https://dnext.atlassian.net/browse/DNP-5707 <https://dnext.atlassian.net/browse/DNP-5707> .

In the meantime you can now update the structure of your dataset correctly and change the hierarchy/level_name of the fields as you want, this should unstuck you. Btw in term of flow if you encounter an issue, raise a ticket to support instead, so we can follow-up in JIRA.

Hello @Benoit Baliguet <mailto:benoit.baliguet@dnext.io>  and @Nicolas Chaperon <mailto:nicolas.chaperon@dnext.io> ,
The issue might be other than that also. Even when I tried to keep only ARG and deleted the other region names in the input file, I was still unable to map the country.
Thanks,
Iheb
