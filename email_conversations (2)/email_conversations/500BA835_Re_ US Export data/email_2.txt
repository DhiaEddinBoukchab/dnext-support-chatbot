Very small point but when i am going through the US export data and looking at the partner data I see we have 21 rows for Netherlands.   Any specific reason?  Is it linked to Netherlands Antilles?

Is there a way yet to download this data onto excel?  When we build our sugar SNDs we consolidate the EU import/export data into a Total EU27 number.   Longer term I wonder whether there could be a way of automating the summation of the EU27 data.
