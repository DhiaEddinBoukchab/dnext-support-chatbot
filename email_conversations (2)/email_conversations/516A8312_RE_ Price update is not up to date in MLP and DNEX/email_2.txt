via a workflow. have u checked the dashboard is set to be updated once the workflow runs?

then you might need to change the frequency at which the client´s dashboard updates.

i understand ours can be updated as the workflow runs but is not the same for clients right?

HI Saber,

 

On Monday, Can you check why price in the dashboard for wheat, corn and potentially others are not reflecting latest prices. Take corn and wheat FOB. We pushed price on Friday morning for 1st May but Roberto and me for corn and whear was seeing only prices for 30th. I pushed today May 01st and May 02 and still I see 30th April. 

Roberto from MLP complained about it. 

 

Thank you
