Hello Quentin,

 

*	For the 1st point 
	=> you should now not see Biofuels & Fertilizers in Business Categories there was a Dashboard for some Reason the “G&O SnD > Europe > Oilseeds Crush Capacity” Dashboard had the Biofuels Business Categories  

As for Renaming I need the dev team permission & the necessary role as I cannot do that now 

 

*	For the 2nd point I need the dev team help & permission as well

Subject: Adjustments to the DNext BF Environment

 

Dear Saber, Dear Support Team,

 

Please see below a list of adjustments that I would like the BF environment of the platform to reflect:

 

1.

Business Categories\Dashboards

Remove Biofuels, Fertilizers, EU Black Fryers

Renaming the system entities:

Grains & oilseeds to be called Grains & Oilseeds

Meat to be called Meat, Livestock & Feed

Eu Black Fryers to be called EU BlackFryers



 

 

2.

Breadcrumb trail

The spelling of some categories is not consistent with the rest of the platform:

“grains_oilseeds” => Grains & Oilseeds



 

“livestock_and_meat” => Meat, Livestock & Feed



 

“tradeflow” => Tradeflow



 

“weather” => Weather



 

“sugar” => Sugar



 

“eu_black_fryers” => EU BlackFryers



 

3.Allocation of Dashboards to business categories

Lineups group: Europe\France, Portugal, Romania, Spain are not showing within the BlackFryers environment although their labelling is already showing EU BlackFryers.

It probably needs to be adjusted somewhere else.

 

*****************************

 

I can provide more explanations if needed.

 

Best Regards,
