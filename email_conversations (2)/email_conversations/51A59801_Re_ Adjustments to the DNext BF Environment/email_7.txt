Dear Saber, Dear Support Team,

Please see below a list of adjustments that I would like the BF environment of the platform to reflect:

1.
Business Categories\Dashboards
Remove Biofuels, Fertilizers, EU Black Fryers
Renaming the system entities:
Grains & oilseeds to be called Grains & Oilseeds
Meat to be called Meat, Livestock & Feed
Eu Black Fryers to be called EU BlackFryers

 
 
2.
Breadcrumb trail
The spelling of some categories is not consistent with the rest of the platform:
“grains_oilseeds” => Grains & Oilseeds

 
“livestock_and_meat” => Meat, Livestock & Feed

 
“tradeflow” => Tradeflow

 
“weather” => Weather

 
“sugar” => Sugar

 
“eu_black_fryers” => EU BlackFryers

 
3.Allocation of Dashboards to business categories
Lineups group: Europe\France, Portugal, Romania, Spain are not showing within the BlackFryers environment although their labelling is already showing EU BlackFryers.
It probably needs to be adjusted somewhere else.

*****************************

I can provide more explanations if needed.

Best Regards,
