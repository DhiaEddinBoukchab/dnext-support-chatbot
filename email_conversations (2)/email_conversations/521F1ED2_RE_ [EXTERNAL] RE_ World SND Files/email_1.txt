Hi Joe,

Unfortunately, I am not aware of any direct logic available that will highlight which CSV file has the latest publication date, I will check with our dev team and let you know once I get the information. However, I can suggest a couple of alternatives:

 

1.	Excel Add-in
	We offer an Excel add-in that allows you to fetch data directly into Excel. This could make it easier for you to access and manage the data. Let us know when you’re available, and we can arrange a quick call to walk you through the setup.
2.	API 
	Alternatively, you can use our API to fetch all the data in one file. This can be done easily using a Python script or any other tool you're comfortable with (e.g., R or any other programming languages). Kindly find attached our API documentation for your reference.

 

Please let us know what works best for you, and we’ll be happy to assist further.

Best regards,

Is there any logic as to which csv file has the latest publication dates?  Do I need to always process all of the files in the zip?

Hi Joe,

 

Thank you for reaching out. 

 

Yes, the change is permanent. It was implemented to improve the management of larger files. However, please note that this change only applies when downloading data through the platform UI. If you're using API integration, you can still download the full dataset in a single file.

Additionally, we are working on improvements to allow smaller datasets to be downloaded in a single file as well.

 

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

 

Best regards,

Team,

 

Did you recently implement a change on the system that breaks the large single csv files for the snd_item-weekly data into multiple csv in a zip file?  Is this a permanent change?  I will have to adjust some of my work flow to accommodate the change if this will be the case going forward.

 

Thanks,
