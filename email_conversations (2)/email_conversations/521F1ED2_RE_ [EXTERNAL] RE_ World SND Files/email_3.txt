Hi Joe,

 

Thank you for reaching out. 

 

Yes, the change is permanent. It was implemented to improve the management of larger files. However, please note that this change only applies when downloading data through the platform UI. If you're using API integration, you can still download the full dataset in a single file.

Additionally, we are working on improvements to allow smaller datasets to be downloaded in a single file as well.

 

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

 

Best regards,

Did you recently implement a change on the system that breaks the large single csv files for the snd_item-weekly data into multiple csv in a zip file?  Is this a permanent change?  I will have to adjust some of my work flow to accommodate the change if this will be the case going forward.

 

Thanks,
