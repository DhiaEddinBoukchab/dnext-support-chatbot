Bessent announcing some volumes. 12mmt of soybeans through January (or through the crop year) while they would commit for 25mmt per year in the next 3 years – on this later part we don’t know if it is soybean or ag products. There are still doubts about the crop year or calendar year and there was an hesitation about the January deadline or if it is crop year.

The 3 years commitment is not so relevant, especially if it is not only beans. As historical volumes are shown below, it has most of the time exceeded this, except for the trade war.

 



 

12mmt is a big number. Especially because the state reserve will for sure need to be involved as there are not 12mmt open in the China coverage. This means stocks piling and “additional” demand for the world SND.

Brazil premiums the way they reacted since the beginning of the week, are going to fight back. US could loose short term 2-3mmt into non-China possibly.

So from the SND standpoint 12mmt = 341mBu carry out / 8% stu but as we lose non-China maybe we can possibly go back up to 433mBu / 10.4% stocks to use. 11usd would be justified if it really happens.

 



 

	
		
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Nothing was confirmed from the Chinese side so far. The execution will be challenging as the commercials wouldn’t be able to participate much in the buying at current prices.

Here is what we know this morning:

Positive tones but no details on agriculture purchase except that Trump mentioned that China will purchase significant amount of US soybeans and other agriculture products : “China would purchase "tremendous amounts" of U.S. soybeans and other farm products "starting immediately"

Many questions remain about how long any trade detente may last. Talking to our China contacts, it seems nothing is announced on substantial amount of soy or ag products. They think China will reduce tariffs accordingly to the 10% reduction and thus, soy will go from 23 to 13% tariffs which will still make US soy uncompetitive and thus, doubt purchase will happen on commercial side but maybe more on the state level to keep “deal” alive. How much? Uncertainty remains. 

 

1.	Tariffs:

US lowers fentanyl tariffs by 10% (20% were added due to fentanyl) bringing tariffs on China to 47%. 

However, China’s ministry of commerce is giving a slight different version according to China Daily :

“The US side will cancel the 10-percent so-called "fentanyl tariffs" and suspend, for an additional year, the 24-percent reciprocal tariffs levied on Chinese goods, including goods from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macao Special Administrative Region, according to a spokesperson of the ministry. China will make corresponding adjustments to its countermeasures against the aforementioned US tariffs, the spokesperson said, noting that both sides have agreed to continue extending certain tariff exclusion measures.

https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202510/30/WS69030e64a310f735438b7d3a.html

Talking to our China contact, the 24% is referring to a tariff that was suppose to come in Nov and which will be put on hold on both sides. 

 

2.	Trade deal

According to South China Morning Post: After the talks, Trump said the US would reduce its fentanyl-related tariffs <https://www.scmp.com/topics/fentanyl-and-other-opioids?module=inline&pgtype=article>  on China by 10 percentage points with immediate effect and expected to see a trade deal with China “pretty soon”. Trump said the two countries agreed he would visit China in April and that Xi would make a trip to the US at “some time”

 

3.	Maritime sanctions should be lifted on both sides:

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce answers questions on the joint arrangement of China-U.S. economic and trade consultations in Kuala Lumpur

.....

III. The U.S. side will suspend for one year the implementation of its Section 301 investigation measures targeting China’s maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries. After the U.S. side suspends these measures, the Chinese side will correspondingly suspend for one year its countermeasures against the U.S.

 

4.	Rare earth: 

China suspends their restrictions. 

 

5.	Export restriction on US technology

Beijing had sought an easing of export controls on sensitive U.S. technology but so far, we cannot find any info on this besides below. 

Reuters: “The leaders did not discuss chipmaker Nvidia's state-of-art Blackwell artificial intelligence chip, Trump said, walking back the previous day's remarks about potentially helping the company to export a scaled-down version of its current flagship GPU processor, a key component in the AI race.”

South China Morning Post: Trump said the two sides discussed Ukraine and semiconductors but not Blackwell chips, which are considered the best AI <https://www.scmp.com/topics/artificial-intelligence?module=inline&pgtype=article>  chips of the American tech company Nvidia <https://www.scmp.com/topics/nvidia?module=inline&pgtype=article> .

 

6.	Duration: One year trade deal

1 year to be renewed annually...

 

7.	Taiwan

Not discussed apparently.

You probably already saw the news but in case not, rumors of China/Cofco buying 3 US soybeans cargo prior to the meeting Trump/Xi tomorrow. 

https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-buys-three-us-soybean-cargoes-ahead-trump-xi-meeting-sources-say-2025-10-29/

fwiw, talking with our contacts in China, they could confirm the purchase this morning. 

 

+ Trump was also in the news yesterday and talk was positive. According to FT, he said that he expected to reach an agreement with Xi. “We are going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both and that’s really a great result…that’s better than fighting”

Speaking on Air Force One, Trump said he would lower the 20 percent tariff he imposed early in his term. “I expect to be lowering that because I believe they can help us with the fentanyl situation”…”we have to get rid of it”.

 

 

Overall, positive tone for meeting tomorrow continues. Chinese side is quiet in the news but their recent action speaks for itself. However, nothing is done and we do not know the details. Is it just lowering tariffs? Does it involve purchase of ag goods beyond soybeans? The details will be important to understand what it means to price.
