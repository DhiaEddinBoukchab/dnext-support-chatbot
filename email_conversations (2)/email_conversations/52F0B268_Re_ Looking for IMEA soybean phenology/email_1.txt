Hello Oscar,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

The IMEA Crop Phenology data has now been assimilated into the crop progress dashboard along with the updates for the latest season.

 

You can visualize it by going to GnO Crop > Brazil > Crop progress dashboard .



Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need anything else.

Hello Oscar,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

The crop phenology is not being published directly by IMEA but are being estimated by our analysts using IMEA data ( planting , harvest) & Crop Cycle.

 

As for your second question , The IMEA Crop phenology dashboard is going to be assimilated in the Brazil Crop Progress dashboard along with the new season estimates, we will let you know once it is done.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Hi Support team,

I see that the Platform has a IMEA Crop Phenology section - but the data stopped at season 2023/24.

*	Home/Dashboards/Grains & Oilseeds/GnO Crop/Brazil/IMEA Crop Phenology


Does IMEA still provide crop phenology? I'm hoping to check the Soybean progress there.

 

Thank you very much,

Oscar
