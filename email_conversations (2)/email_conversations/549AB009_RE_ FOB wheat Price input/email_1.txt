Please see attached values for trade date 19th Feb 2025.

I have been having a look at the dashboards and think I may need a training call… I can see Wheat SND tables by country and was wondering if there is a world wheat balance sheet similar to what the USDA publish?

Can we organise a time to walk me through the basics?
