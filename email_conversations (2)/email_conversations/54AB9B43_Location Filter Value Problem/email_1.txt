Hello All,
It seems that the newly added feature for filtering by location type (regional_national / regional) is preventing me from updating this dataset. Even when I leave the field empty, it defaults to NATIONAL_REGION, while my dataset is actually a merge of REGIONS and NATIONAL_REGIONS.
Is there any workaround for this issue?
