Subject: Dataset versionning, wrong time display (likely timezone)
Message-ID: GV0P278MB01488791DA93BDF087637F0698F22@GV0P278MB0148.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM

================================================================================

This workflow is scheduled to run at 5am Paris time.

I’m in the same time zone. When going to “Version” tab of the view dataset, I see the date is 4.34am, which I suspect is 4.34 UTC = 5.34 Paris time

Moreover, it tells me 5 hours ago, while it’s supposed to be 4 hours ago, but I guess it’s the same problem.
