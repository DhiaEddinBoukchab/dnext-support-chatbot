Hello Pablo,
The source for Ukraine hasn’t published updates since December. 
For rapeseed, the dashboard uses the planting year as the crop year for planting and the harvesting year as the crop year for harvesting, so the crop year needs shifting in planting. Also, regarding the data checking, I’ll start working on a new script and re-scrape the latest available data for comparison 


Best,
Iheb
