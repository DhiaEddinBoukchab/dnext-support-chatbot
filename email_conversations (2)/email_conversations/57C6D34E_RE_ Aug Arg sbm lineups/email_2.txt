Hi,

What is the final Arg sbm export number for August? The lineups say 3054 tmt, but the grids still show 2920. I'm not sure if there were changes from the Sep 29th lineups, but the 2920 was the number before the month was over so it shouldn't be that. 

I haven't checked other commodities, but can you put those in too if they aren't updated?

Thanks
