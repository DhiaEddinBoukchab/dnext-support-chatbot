Hi Saber,

 

We have been using your platform to view Corn and Soybeans FOB and CNF prices. Are they available via your API as well? (I cannot find any in the Datasets List)

 

Thank you very much,

Hi Saber,

 

Thank you very much! I confirm that I can see the latest CIF NOLA Corn now!

 

On a separate but possibly related note: I noticed that the Soybean FOB prices were last updated a week ago on 6/24 (screenshot below).

Could you help check whether that one will be updated soon?

Subject: CIF NOLA Corn price update lag?

 

Hi Support team,

 

I was looking for CIF NOLA Corn basis, only to find out that for July, the last update was June 18 (a week ago from today, June 25).

 

So I want to check whether that is a typical lag or something happened either with your source or within your process.
