Hello Scott,

 

Apologies for the Delayed Response.

 

There is data from 2023 onward in the dataset , just that for 2023 and 2024 there is only the final data not the versions . we have only added the versions for 2025 so far and we are working on 2023 and 2024.


You should use the “ETS Reporter” Column as a reference.

 

Please let us know if you have any other questions or inquiries.

Hi Saber, 

 

We have finally had some cycles to start using your data and have noticed that right now we do not see much history in our dataset.  We’re expecting quite a lot of history – but only see data back to earlier in 2025.  Would it be possible to either post the full history to our dataset or to send us a one-time bulk dump of the history?  The Cut-Off Date you’ve added is quite useful and if the history can have that as well to the extent that’s possible, that would be great.

 

Thank you!

Scott
