Hi all – possible to get some attention on this?  It’s not urgent, but I was hoping we’d have some kind of response after 1 business day and I more want to make sure it’s not vanishing into the aether of unread emails.

 

Thanks,

Hi Saber, 

 

We have finally had some cycles to start using your data and have noticed that right now we do not see much history in our dataset.  We’re expecting quite a lot of history – but only see data back to earlier in 2025.  Would it be possible to either post the full history to our dataset or to send us a one-time bulk dump of the history?  The Cut-Off Date you’ve added is quite useful and if the history can have that as well to the extent that’s possible, that would be great.

 

Thank you!

Scott
