Hello Scott,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Concerning your inquiry regarding the dataset version. Currently, this feature is not available via the API. However, we plan to implement it in the near future.

 

In the meantime, we are preparing a dataset that includes all historical data, along with a publication date column to help with interpretation.

 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

 

Best regards,

Hello Scott,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

Yes, we do support API access. 

Authentication is handled using the login credentials we provided, which will generate an access token. This token can then be used to make authorized requests to our API.

 

For your convenience, I’ve attached a PDF containing a Python script that demonstrates how to authenticate and download a dataset via the API. This should help you get started quickly.

 

Let me know how it works out for you, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or run into any issues,I’m happy to help.

Thanks – I just took a quick look and didn’t see any API key creation.  Do you support API access or should I just be “scraping” our dataset by logging in?
