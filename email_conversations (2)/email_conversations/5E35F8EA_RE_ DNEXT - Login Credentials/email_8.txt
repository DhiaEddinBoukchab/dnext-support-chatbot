Hello Scott,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

Yes, we do support API access. 

Authentication is handled using the login credentials we provided, which will generate an access token. This token can then be used to make authorized requests to our API.

 

For your convenience, I’ve attached a PDF containing a Python script that demonstrates how to authenticate and download a dataset via the API. This should help you get started quickly.

 

Let me know how it works out for you, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or run into any issues,I’m happy to help.

 

Best regards,

Thanks – I just took a quick look and didn’t see any API key creation.  Do you support API access or should I just be “scraping” our dataset by logging in?
