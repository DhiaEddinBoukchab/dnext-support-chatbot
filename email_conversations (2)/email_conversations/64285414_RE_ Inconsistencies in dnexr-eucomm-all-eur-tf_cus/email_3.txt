Subject: Inconsistencies in dnexr-eucomm-all-eur-tf_customs-monthly
Message-ID: GV0P278MB1317371B651559EF6913172381C4A@GV0P278MB1317.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM

Hi Support,

I have been reported some inconsistencies in dataset dnexr-eucomm-all-eur-tf_customs-monthly, with a small group of products always having a quantity set to 0 (PORK_MEAT, WHT, BOVINE_ANIMALS_BEEF_MEAT_FRESH, BOVINE_ANIMALS_BEEF_MEAT_FROZEN).

Query:

SELECT "Product", COUNT(*) AS "countp"
FROM "dnexr-eucomm-all-eur-tf_customs-monthly"
GROUP BY "Product"
HAVING MAX("Quantity") = 0
ORDER BY "countp" DESC
LIMIT 100;

Can you double check if this is expected?

Benoît
