Hello,

 

Just a quick one – why are you lower than USDA on acres? I assumed it was due to prevent plant/beans rotations in delta or something but I don’t see the commensurate change in bean acreage. Also, do you think there’s any hope for corn from the trade deals? China doesn’t seem to need corn at all, and India would need to make big policy changes to allow the importation of GMO corn which would surely upset their powerful farming lobby…

 

Thanks,

Alexander
