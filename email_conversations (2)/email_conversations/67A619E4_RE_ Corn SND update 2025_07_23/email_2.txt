Hi Alexander,

 

Just following up on my previous message regarding a call this week , I had suggested Today at 5 PM Geneva time, but I didn’t hear back, and no invite was sent.

 

Would next Tuesday at 5 PM Geneva time work for you and your colleague instead?

 

Let me know what suits you best, and I’ll be happy to send over a calendar invitation accordingly.

Hello,

 

Just a quick one – why are you lower than USDA on acres? I assumed it was due to prevent plant/beans rotations in delta or something but I don’t see the commensurate change in bean acreage. Also, do you think there’s any hope for corn from the trade deals? China doesn’t seem to need corn at all, and India would need to make big policy changes to allow the importation of GMO corn which would surely upset their powerful farming lobby…

 

Thanks,
