Hello!

One name is used for the same regions in the soil moisture for Australia. This happens also for other regions, not just the one shown.

If possible, could we align Precipitation and Soil moisture names, please? You may add the Province to distinguish i.e., VIC - Northern, NSW - Northern, etc.

If possible, would it be possible to use the regional names (official), in the photos below for Victoria and New South Wales, please?
