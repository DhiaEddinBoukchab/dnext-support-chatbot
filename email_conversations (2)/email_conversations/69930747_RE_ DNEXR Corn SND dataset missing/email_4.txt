Hi Saber and Guillaume

 

Hope you’re doing well. Just replying to this email as it was our last communication. 

 

In the Corn SND dataset, it seems some monthly forecasts are actually annual ones. Below are examples for Arg and Brazil production. If I filter out the forecasts and only use the ‘calculations’ then I’ll be missing a lot of future data points so it’s quite difficult to automate our use of the data in our own SNDs.

 



 

Here for Brazil the forecasts/calculations alternate, both of which state a monthly value period but obviously the one is not. They also fall on the same publication date so when constructing the historical SNDs, it becomes a question of which to use – the process of automating this over all countries/commodities for all the datasets we have access to becomes very difficult.

Hi Guillaume and Saber

 

It seems the DNEXR Corn SND dataset is no longer available on the platform or through the API (the code was “polarstar-c4ffcc58-c9b0-4935-a0c8-b93f28d7d674”). The SND datasets for other commodities are still available though. Could you please assist, thanks.
