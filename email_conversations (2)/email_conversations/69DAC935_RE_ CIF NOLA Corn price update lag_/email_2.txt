Hi Saber,

Thank you very much! I confirm that I can see the latest CIF NOLA Corn now!

On a separate but possibly related note: I noticed that the Soybean FOB prices were last updated a week ago on 6/24 (screenshot below).
Could you help check whether that one will be updated soon?

Subject: CIF NOLA Corn price update lag?

 

Hi Support team,

 

I was looking for CIF NOLA Corn basis, only to find out that for July, the last update was June 18 (a week ago from today, June 25).

 

So I want to check whether that is a typical lag or something happened either with your source or within your process.
