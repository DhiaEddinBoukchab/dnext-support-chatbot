Subject: CIF NOLA Corn price update lag?

 

Hi Support team,

 

I was looking for CIF NOLA Corn basis, only to find out that for July, the last update was June 18 (a week ago from today, June 25).

 

So I want to check whether that is a typical lag or something happened either with your source or within your process.
