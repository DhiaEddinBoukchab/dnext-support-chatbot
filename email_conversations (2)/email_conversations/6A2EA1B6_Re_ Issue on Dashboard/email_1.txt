Hello,
It’s working perfectly on my end. Could you please refresh the dashboard? It may be an issue with Microsoft Power BI servers.
Thanks,
Jebrane

Hello,

 

I'm experiencing an issue with the weather dashboard. When I try to copy the output using the embedded function, an error appears.

Additionally, taking a screenshot isn’t an option, as the title displays below the chart.

Could you take a look at this?

Thanks,
