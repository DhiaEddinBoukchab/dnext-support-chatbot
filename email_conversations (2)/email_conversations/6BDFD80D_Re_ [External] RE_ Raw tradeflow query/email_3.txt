Hi guys,

 

It has been very exciting to navigate through your platform, but as you would expect, questions come along the way. Here is one to start, please.

 

I have downloaded the raws tradeflow – see below, and it is my understanding that what is allocated to ICELAND is actually your estimated surplus. If that is correct, it means you are showing a cumulative surplus of 5.42 M mt of raw sugar by Sept-25. However, when I look at the weekly market report shared earlier this week by John, it shows a global raw sugar cumulative trade flow of 2.22 M mt by Sept-26 (I copied below the table I am looking at). So clearly, I am looking at something the wrong way, and would appreciate if you could guide me to the correct one, please.

 

Many thanks and regards,
