Hi Matias,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

You’re right to notice the discrepancy between the values in the Supply and Demand Report and the TradeMatrix. The reason for this difference lies in the way the crop year is defined in each report:

 

*	Supply and Demand Report (S&D): The crop year starts in August and ends in July.

 

*	TradeMatrix: The crop year starts in October and ends in September.

 

Because of this, the yearly values in the two reports do not match exactly.

 

To Align the Data:

 

If you download the TradeMatrix and filter it by the months that correspond to the same crop year as in the SND report, the values will match.



 

 

Please let me know if you have any more questions.

 

Best regards,

Hi Dnext support, can you please confirm if those 2 numbers should match? The ones coming from Supply/Demand Dnext relative to Trade Flows (i.e. exports).
