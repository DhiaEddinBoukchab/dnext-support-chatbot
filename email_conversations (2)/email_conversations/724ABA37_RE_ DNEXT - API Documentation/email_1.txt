	Hi Mikko,

	 

	Thanks for reaching out!

	 

	We’ve tested the API on our end, and it's returning more data than you've mentioned. If you're loading the data into an Excel sheet, it might not be capturing everything, as the dataset contains around 5 million rows, and Excel’s sheet limit is 1 million.

	 

	If you’re still seeing discrepancies, feel free to share more details.

	 

	We are also available for a quick teams call to check things on your end.

	 

	Best regards,
