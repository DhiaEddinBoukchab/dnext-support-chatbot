      "body_text": "Hi John, thank you for your message. I don’t want to overcomplicate things at this stage. I am not looking for the allocation of where the monthly surplus or deficit sits, but simply to be able to correctly see your monthly exports and imports forecast by country, which results on your estimated surplus/(deficit) by month (trade flow balance). Unfortunately, the data currently available at the platform doesn’t show the balance of the trade flow correctly, as previously explained, therefore I cannot know which country is wrongly reflecting your current forecast.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMay I suggest a simple solution which I believe would fix the problem? If all the exports/imports data which are still a forecast would be reported in the platform with an UNALLOCATED counterparty, as exemplified below, using some numbers currently reported in your platform for a few countries  - i.e. all exports forecast would be allocated to a “new partner/destination) here named “Unallocated” and all imports would also be allocated to a “new origin” also called “unallocated” -  I would be able to see all your exports/imports forecast by month and by country and from there calculate the monthly surplus/deficit of your estimated trade flow. This solution could also be applied to the whites trade flow.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nAlessandra\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: John Stansfield <john.stansfield@dnext.io> \r\nSent: 16 December 2025 11:33\r\nTo: Alessandra Carruthers <acarruthers@dvtglobal.com>; Mohamed Elasfoury <mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io>\r\nCc: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io>; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io>; Samy Deramchi <sderamchi@dvtglobal.com>; Camila Baldin <camila.baldin@dnext.io>\r\nSubject: Re: [External] Re: New TRADE MATRIX download option\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlessandra - the basic issue is that we dont currently have the allocation of where the surpluses sit when not in CS Brazil.

I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCould you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your assistance.

This solution could also be applied to the whites\r\n trade flow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><img width=\"677\" height=\"193\" style=\"width:7.05in;height:2.0083in\" id=\"Picture_x0020_1\" src=\"cid:image001.png@01DC6E9D.AF957240\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\">What do you think?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\">Thanks again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\">Alessandra<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"border:none;border-top:solid #E1E1E1 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 0cm 0cm 0cm\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">From:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"> John Stansfield &lt;john.stansfield@dnext.io&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sent:</b> 16 December 2025 11:33<br>\r\n<b>To:</b> Alessandra Carruthers &lt;acarruthers@dvtglobal.com&gt;; Mohamed Elasfoury &lt;mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io&gt;<br>\r\n<b>Cc:</b> Saber Khalfallah &lt;saber.khalfallah@dnext.io&gt;; Support Dnext &lt;support@dnext.io&gt;; Samy Deramchi &lt;sderamchi@dvtglobal.com&gt;; Camila Baldin &lt;camila.baldin@dnext.io&gt;<br>\r\n<b>Subject:</b> Re: [External] Re: New TRADE MATRIX download option<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-line-height-alt:.75pt\"><span style=\"font-size:1.0pt;color:white\">Alessandra - the basic issue is that we dont currently have the allocation of where the surpluses sit when not in CS Brazil.

I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCould you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your assistance.

I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCould you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your assistance. And have a lovely weekend!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAlessandra\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Mohamed Elasfoury <mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io <mailto:mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io> >\r\nSent: 12 December 2025 09:41\r\nTo: Alessandra Carruthers <acarruthers@dvtglobal.com <mailto:acarruthers@dvtglobal.com> >\r\nCc: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> >; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> >; John Stansfield <john.stansfield@dnext.io <mailto:john.stansfield@dnext.io> >; Samy Deramchi <sderamchi@dvtglobal.com <mailto:sderamchi@dvtglobal.com> >; Camila Baldin <camila.baldin@dnext.io <mailto:camila.baldin@dnext.io> >\r\nSubject: [External] Re: New TRADE MATRIX download option\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHello Alessandra, I hope you are doing well Thank you for the feedback.

I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCould you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your assistance. And have a lovely weekend!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAlessandra\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Mohamed Elasfoury <mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io <mailto:mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io> >\r\nSent: 12 December 2025 09:41\r\nTo: Alessandra Carruthers <acarruthers@dvtglobal.com <mailto:acarruthers@dvtglobal.com> >\r\nCc: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> >; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> >; John Stansfield <john.stansfield@dnext.io <mailto:john.stansfield@dnext.io> >; Samy Deramchi <sderamchi@dvtglobal.com <mailto:sderamchi@dvtglobal.com> >; Camila Baldin <camila.baldin@dnext.io <mailto:camila.baldin@dnext.io> >\r\nSubject: [External] Re: New TRADE MATRIX download option\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHello Alessandra, I hope you are doing well Thank you for the feedback.

I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCould you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your assistance. And have a lovely weekend!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAlessandra\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Mohamed Elasfoury <mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io <mailto:mohamed.elasfoury@dnext.io> >\r\nSent: 12 December 2025 09:41\r\nTo: Alessandra Carruthers <acarruthers@dvtglobal.com <mailto:acarruthers@dvtglobal.com> >\r\nCc: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> >; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> >; John Stansfield <john.stansfield@dnext.io <mailto:john.stansfield@dnext.io> >; Samy Deramchi <sderamchi@dvtglobal.com <mailto:sderamchi@dvtglobal.com> >; Camila Baldin <camila.baldin@dnext.io <mailto:camila.baldin@dnext.io> >\r\nSubject: [External] Re: New TRADE MATRIX download option\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHello Alessandra, I hope you are doing well Thank you for the feedback.

I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHaving said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCould you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMany thanks for your assistance.
