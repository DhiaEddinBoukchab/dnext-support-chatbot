Dear Mohamed,

 

Thank you very much! I confirm having received the message with the link to download the excel file which is exactly what was I was looking for. Perfect, thanks again!

 

Now I need some more help to get the balance of your trade flows correctly, please.

 

Based on that downloaded data, I can see the following bottom lines (estimated surplus/(deficits) for your Raws trade flows, assuming you always allocate to ICELAND your estimated surplus/deficit (PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EVER USE A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION TO ALLOCATE YOUR SURPLUS/DEFICIT).

 



 

 

As you can see, it matches with the below screenshot of the section of your RAW trade matrix from your platform, highlighting the allocation to ICELAND (ISL) where you allocate the surplus/deficit, except for Dec/25 and Feb/26. 

 





 

 

That is because the data downloaded from the file you sent me this morning indeed shows a different allocation to ICELAND (ISL) to the ones shown in your RAW trade matrix in your platform for Dec/25 and Feb/26, as you can see below:

 



 

 

Having said that, when I look at the quarterly trade flows in your platform – see below, they are showing other different numbers, which don’t match with what is allocated to ICELAND (i.e. your surplus/deficit) in your raw trade matrix mentioned above. Curiously, the Q1/26 surplus of my calculations from the downloaded data you sent me this morning matches with the below number. But all the others are completely different, both to my calculations from downloaded data this morning and to your raw trade matrix. 

 



 

 

Could you please check and make the necessary corrections to the data you will send me daily to download from the platform so I can read the balance of your trade flows correctly (Surplus/deficit), please?

 

Once we fix the Raws, I will need your help to understand how I can see your monthly estimated surplus/deficit for your Whites (refined/100s/150s) trade flows, because now all I can see from the downloaded data is a perfectly balanced whites trade flow. Perhaps you want to start sharing the excel files with detailed information for each country’s estimates which support the trade flows you report in your platform (below).

 



 

Many thanks for your assistance. And have a lovely weekend!

 

Kind regards,

Alessandra

Thank you for the feedback. We have setup a process to send you a daily email in the morning with an excel file in the format you described (It includes the data from the 4 trade matrices, the actuals and the forecasts). The first email should have arrived. Please let us know if this solution works for you and if you have any feedback so that we adjust on our side

 

Best regards,

Subject: New TRADE MATRIX download option 

 

Hello Mohamed, I hope you are well.

 

Would it be possible to create a new DOWNLOAD option for the TRADE MATRIX where we would combine the FORECAST data (Sugar Forecast Automated) with the OBSERVED data (history data/actuals) for all sugars (discriminated by quality), in the same format which we currently get when we download the FORECAST (sample below)?

 

I am aware we currently have the option to download the Trade Matrixes of each sugar quality (product) separately which combine the observed (history data) and forecast data, but I would also like to have them all in one single file and in the simple format shown below (current FORECAST), if possible.

 

In summary, I would like you to add a new button next to FORECAST under TRADEMATRIX to read ACTUALS+FORECAST which would allow us to download all the history data plus the forecast of all products on a monthly basis, in the same format I am currently downloading only the FORECAST.

 

Sample of FORECAST download:



 

Many thanks for your consideration.

 

Kind regards,
