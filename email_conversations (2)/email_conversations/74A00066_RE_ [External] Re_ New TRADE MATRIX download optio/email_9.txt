Hello Mohamed, I hope you are well.

 

Would it be possible to create a new DOWNLOAD option for the TRADE MATRIX where we would combine the FORECAST data (Sugar Forecast Automated) with the OBSERVED data (history data/actuals) for all sugars (discriminated by quality), in the same format which we currently get when we download the FORECAST (sample below)? 

 

I am aware we currently have the option to download the Trade Matrixes of each sugar quality (product) separately which combine the observed (history data) and forecast data, but I would also like to have them all in one single file and in the simple format shown below (current FORECAST), if possible. 

 

In summary, I would like you to add a new button next to FORECAST under TRADEMATRIX to read ACTUALS+FORECAST which would allow us to download all the history data plus the forecast of all products on a monthly basis, in the same format I am currently downloading only the FORECAST. 

 

Sample of FORECAST download:



 

Many thanks for your consideration.

 

Kind regards,
