Bonjour Charles,

 

Hope you had a good trip and made it back to Paris safely. We have the trial environment ready for you – aside from yourself and Priyanka, are there any other users you need? Our customer success team (cc’ed in) will reach out with log-ins and can give you a platform tour on where to find what. 

 

So the environment as it stands is just the start, we can then help you with your own data scraping (securely and firewalled off just for you if required) and of course can create specific dashboards as you like. Also if there is specific data you are looking for please let us know. My whatsapp number is also in my signature so feel free to reach out any time.

 

Any further questions let us know!

 

All the best,

Dear Priyanka and Charles,

 

Thank you for a good call this morning, I have attached the latest weekly and bi-weekly reports for your perusal. 

 

We are currently finishing the west Africa lineups datasets and need a little bit of time to review the work, would you like the trial to start before or after this is finished? If after, it would be better to start the trial towards the end of next week. 

 

In the meantime, please find my whatsapp number in my signature, feel free to reach out any time.
