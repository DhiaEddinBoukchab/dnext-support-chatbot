Hello Saurabh,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

You should now be able to see the Ethanol in the USA Ethanol Tab.

 

As for your second inquiry no the address was not changed and we did receive your request there is just a bug in jira which they are currently working on.

 

Please let me know if all is working well on your end.

 

Best regards,
