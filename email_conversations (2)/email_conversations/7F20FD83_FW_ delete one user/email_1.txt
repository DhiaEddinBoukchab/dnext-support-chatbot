Hi Marcelo,

How are you?

Quick admin stuff. We get many emails that are bouncing back on fabio.hirose@jbs.com.br <mailto:fabio.hirose@jbs.com.br> 

We know he left JBS but it seems he is still in your global risk email list. Let me know if something can be done on your end.

Not urgent.

Thank you

Guillaume

He was removed some time ago, but it seems he is still part of a distribution list that is included in our JBS distribution list, which is managed by them,
