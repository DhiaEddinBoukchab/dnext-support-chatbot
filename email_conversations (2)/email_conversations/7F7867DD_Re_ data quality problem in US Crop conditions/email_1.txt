Hello all,

What I'm seeing is that we currently have at least three different datasets for U.S. crop conditions. Adding to that views and a dataprep.

My plan is to create a new, consolidated dataset with cleaned and corrected data (QuickStat data + the report data). Once we review and approve it, we’ll share only that dataset going forward(As we can not share Views), and I’ll use it in the new dashboard also.

P.S. I’ll apply the same approach to the Crop Progress data as well.




Thanks,
Iheb

as an example, filter by week 19, winter wheat crop conditions. some states (not all) have duplicates

@Iheb Mhamdi <mailto:iheb.mhamdi@dnext.io>  this one needs to be solved ASAP as we’re sharing the datasets with clients.

Objet : data quality problem in US Crop conditions 
 
Hi guys, in the US crop conditions dataset there are duplicates in 2024 (at least).

i know we are solving by calculating an average using the week. point is that publication date is different so a fast remove duplicates does not not work unless we know this.

think this needs to be solved, because if we share this with a client then there will be issues.
