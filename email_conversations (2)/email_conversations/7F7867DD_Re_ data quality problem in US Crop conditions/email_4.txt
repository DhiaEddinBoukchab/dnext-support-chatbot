Subject: data quality problem in US Crop conditions
Message-ID: GV0P278MB0717868D88F0A61983320019EB8AA@GV0P278MB0717.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM

================================================================================

Hi guys, in the US crop conditions dataset there are duplicates in 2024 (at least).

i know we are solving by calculating an average using the week. point is that publication date is different so a fast remove duplicates does not not work unless we know this.

think this needs to be solved, because if we share this with a client then there will be issues.
