Subject: US cotton production dataset

 

Hi Saber,

 

Hope all is going well!

 

I’d like to create another cotton production dataset and I was wondering if the team could provide support for this. Here are the main details:

 

Type of data: US cotton production

Frequency: Daily

URL source: “https://www.ewrinc.com/cotton/contentPublic/reports/stateReceipts.aspx <https://www.ewrinc.com/cotton/contentPublic/reports/stateReceipts.aspx> ”

 

Details: 

The table (snapshot below) reported in the URL is refreshed daily, the idea is to create a dataset that adds daily the new information. An important point to notice is that the table gets replaced daily with a new one and there’s no history to access, so we need a recurring task that can scrap the table from the website every day.

 



 

Let me know please if there’s any questions on this,

 

Regards

 

R
