Hello support,

I noticed that when clicking on dashboards, by default the first dashboard shown is "France" for compound feed production. I believe this action is missing up with the user activity statistics
As you can see here, I filtered out only to the most 7 active clients, and the France dashboard is the 2nd most viewed dashboard

I suggest when clicking on dashboards, the output should be none, unless the user clicks on the final dashboard name.

The issue is repeated to every first dashboard that exists in the main dashboards categories tab

Best regards,
