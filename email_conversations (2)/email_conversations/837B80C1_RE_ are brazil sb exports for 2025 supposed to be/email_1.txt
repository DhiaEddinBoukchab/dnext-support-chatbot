Hi Jennie,

 

The 2 don’t match because I made an adjustment in the Brazil SND but not yet reflected it into the tradeflow, given the situation rapidly evolving in Argentina.

So the good number is the one in dropbox, Ill re-align the trade matrix now that the dust settled on Arg export license.

 

Sorry for the confusion..

Trade matrix shows 111,494 but the snd (both dropbox and snd dashboard says 110,494. Since it's both dropbox and dashboard say the same, I am adding support too in case it's just the trade matrix needs to be uploaded.
