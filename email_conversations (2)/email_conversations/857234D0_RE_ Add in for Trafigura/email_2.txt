Hi Saber,

 

Léo, in copy of this email, wants to access some data into excel.

Is it possible to help him install the add-in please ? and show how to use.

The dataset that he needs to access is the following, please make sure it is shared with Trafigura environment.

"DATASET"."dnexr-structured-uscensus-gno-usa-tf_customs-monthly"

 

I use an SQL power query myself, this is what I do.

The goal would be to replicate the output of this on his excel.

 

Thanks !

 

****THE SQL CODE BELOW***

 

SELECT "Country Partner":"Name"::string as "Country Partner", "Trade Direction":"Code"::string as "Trade Direction",

CASE 

    WHEN LEFT("Product":"Source",4) = '1501' THEN 'FATPAP' 

    WHEN LEFT("Product":"Source",4) = '1502' THEN 'FATBAS'

    WHEN LEFT("Product":"Source",4) = '1503' THEN 'LARD'

    WHEN LEFT("Product":"Source",4) = '1516' THEN 'UCO1516'

    WHEN LEFT("Product":"Source",4) = '1518' THEN 'UCO1518' 

    ELSE '' 

END as "Product", "Quantity", "Date Reporter"

FROM "DATASET"."dnexr-structured-uscensus-gno-usa-tf_customs-monthly"

WHERE LEFT("Product":"Source",4) IN ('1501','1502','1503','1516','1518')
