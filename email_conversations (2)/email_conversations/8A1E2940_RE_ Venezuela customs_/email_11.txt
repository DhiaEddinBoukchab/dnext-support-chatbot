Hi Saber,

Rice, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, palm oil, wheat, corn, and sorghum. Please use the HS codes that you use for the other customs data (I've been considering that the HS codes across the countries are the same so everything can be compared apples to apples). I prefer whatever history you can, I'd say the minimum of 2020 please. 

Thanks you
