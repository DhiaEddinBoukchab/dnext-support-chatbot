Hello Sami,

 

Many thanks for your email. 

 

I use several APIs. I have a question, can I continue using the current UIDs until the 21st of Feb and on this date should I check within my datasets for the “duplicate” one with the new code?

Otherwise, I didn’t understand how to switch to the new UIDs.

 

Thanks and regards

Dear All,

 

We are continuously working to improve your experience on our data platform. As part of our ongoing enhancements, we are automating the sharing of datasets, tradeflows and dashboards based on your subscription.

 

What this means for you:

*	You will automatically receive access to the resources included in your subscription. 
*	In case of changes or evolution of the resources, your access will be updated dynamically.

 

This change aims to streamline the process, ensuring you have timely and seamless access to the data you need. 

 

Is there any impact for our current users? Yes for clients using APIs. The datasets and tradeflows UIDs will be changed. It is possible that you will have twice the list of datasets and tradeflows (new code / old code) within your environment. This issue will be solved when the new sharing solution will be deployed. The implementation of this change will take place on February 21st, 2025.

 

Should you encounter any issues or have any questions, our support team is available to assist you at support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> 

 

Thank you for your continued trust in our platform.

 

Kind regards
