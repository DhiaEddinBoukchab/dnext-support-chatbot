Subject: can we remove some colors like grey or very soft tones from the dashboards?

================================================================================

with the recent changes we have some color selections which make the charts really difficult to visualize. can we remove some colors which dont seem to be a good choice? even highlighting the line is hard to see.

adding @Quentin Doublet <mailto:quentin.doublet@blackfryers.io>  as he has been working on this i believe. if not disregard.
