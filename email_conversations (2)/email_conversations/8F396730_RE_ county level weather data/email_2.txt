Hi, 

 

Looking for county level weather data in the US, using this query: 

user = 'ZIMB-RBUCCIARELLI'
password = 'YZ8f@uX@.ZVt!uCYArMyjz7XZCd3pi*ggF9VZeHneFPj7_ya'
account = 'gq42038.eu-west-1'
warehouse = 'ZIMB'
database = 'LAB'
schema = ''

 

 

cur.execute("SELECT * FROM \"ZIMB\".\"LAB\".\"usa-weather\" WHERE \"Region\" = 'Texas'")

 

 

However, only getting state level data. 

 

How do I get county level realized and forecast data?

 

Best,
