Hi Pablo,

 

I hope you’re well,

 

Could you please advise about how should I read below Russian Soft wheat lineup data in Dnext for 24/25 and 25/26?

 

When I chose starring month for July and product soft wheat, I see 24/25 export amount became 73 MMT and current marketing year I thought Russia have 43- 48 MMT wheat export potential, but line up data already catch 37 MMT in November.

 

Are these numbers accurate? If these numbers accurate, how should I read or how can I find the real monthly export number for Russia?

 

Also, could you please advise the difference between Russia (All) and Russia (TBI) section what is TBI meaning?

 

Thanks in advance for your help,

 



 

Best Regards,
