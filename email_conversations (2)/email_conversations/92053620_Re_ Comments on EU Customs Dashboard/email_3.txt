Here i see we need to have in mind that the update dates of the intraflows and extra flows are different. intraflows are reported later. so we end up showing a 0 here which is no final.

also in this dashboard i think we neeed to add another filter which is the reporter country as the user might want to visualize EU as a whole or country by country (partner and reported)
