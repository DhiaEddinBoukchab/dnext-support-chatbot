Hi Saber,

 

Could you please setup a demo account for Qube.

Please reach out to :

marcello.moreira@qube-rt.com <mailto:marcello.moreira@qube-rt.com> 

 

Would be good if you organize a deeper intro and walk them through the demo account instead of letting them explore themselves.

Check with him who needs access.

 

Thanks
