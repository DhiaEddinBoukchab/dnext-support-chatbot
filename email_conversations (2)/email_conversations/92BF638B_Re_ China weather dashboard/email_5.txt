================================================================================

Guys I'm looking at the China weather dashboard we have in the platform and there are many things that are strange...


1.	
	Henan temps in the 11/15 are above normal in the graph but the map shows the opposite (temps 1.23°C below normal for that period).
2.	
	The filters in the map are super confusing i never know what im doing there....we just want to see if min or max temp is above or below normal, the max/average/min...i dont know what is doing, and if we are showing the deviation vs the max/min/average of the period selected for me at least is not very useful.










if i select min in the filter then i get this which is telling me that temps are 20°C below!
