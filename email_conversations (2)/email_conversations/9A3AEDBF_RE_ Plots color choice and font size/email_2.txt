Hello Support,

Please have a look at the 2 following plots:   
the first one is from last year ; the style is ok and you clearly see the different years as colors do separate well, 
the second one is the new style; font size is too small now  (I always use bold type to be sure I can read title, title axis…) the line of 2022 is almost not visible and it is hard to distinguish 2024 and 2023… 
can we have some improvements ?  can we go back to old color palette ?  nothing urgent…!  
thank you.
