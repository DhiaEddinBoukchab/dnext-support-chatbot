Hello Khalil,

 

After checking, it appears that the concerned user is included in one of their internal distribution lists managed by their own organization and not directly added to any of our distribution lists.

If he wants to be removed, I suggest that he contacts his organization’s IT team, as these distribution lists include other recipients who are interested in the reports we send.

 



 

Best regards,
