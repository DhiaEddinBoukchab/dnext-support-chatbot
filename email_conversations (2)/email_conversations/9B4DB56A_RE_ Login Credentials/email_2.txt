I hope you are well. I am following up on our call yesterday. Your platform environment has been created. It is empty for now. 

We have also created a robot email address that will be your own (dedicated to you/Seaforthke). The email is: bot+seaforthke@data.dnext.io <mailto:bot+seaforthke@data.dnext.io> . I have cc the email address. It means your platform will be receiving this email. 

Step 2:

Please send the data you want us to process. You can send all the emails you want us to process. Actual and historical. Would you mind copying lineups@dnext.io <mailto:lineups@dnext.io>  and Farouk? This way, we will see what you have sent and give the right instructions to our team. 

Step 3:

We will process all the data and create several database

Step 4: 

We will create reports/dashboards based the data you sent

Step 5:

We review the dashboards with you and do some back and forth until you are happy with the end results.
