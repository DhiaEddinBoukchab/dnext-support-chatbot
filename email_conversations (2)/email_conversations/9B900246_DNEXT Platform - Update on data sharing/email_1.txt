This update aims to streamline access and ensure you always have the most relevant data available for you.

 

Key Points:

*	Automated Access: You will automatically receive access to the resources included in your subscription.
*	Dynamic Updates: Any changes or updates to your resources will be reflected in your access dynamically.

Impact on Current Users:

*	For clients using APIs, please note that the datasets and tradeflow UIDs will be updated.
