Hello Support,
We’ve identified several tables in the DNEXR database with 0–15 rows. Could you please confirm if these are still needed? If not, thanks to delete all of them.
@Benoit Baliguet <mailto:benoit.baliguet@dnext.io>  I’ve created a ticket to add the unused tables to the dashboard that Nader created : https://dnext.atlassian.net/browse/DNP-4661 <https://dnext.atlassian.net/browse/DNP-4661> 
Best regards,
Jebrane
