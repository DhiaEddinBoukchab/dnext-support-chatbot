Hello Oscar,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

Unfortunately, we currently do not provide versioning for the TradeMatrix or datasets. This feature is planned for future releases of the platform.

 

In the meantime, I will check internally with the team to see if we can provide a temporary solution for you. To help us explore this, could you please let me know which TradeMatrices you are interested in, and if there are multiple,which ones should be prioritized?

 

Looking forward to your response.

 

Best regards,

Subject: TradeMatrix older versions?

 

Hi Support Team,


As is in SnD, it's often useful to see how estimates have evolved over time - for TradeMatrix. Do you currently provide a way for me to see an older version, either on the Platform or through API?



Thank you very much,
