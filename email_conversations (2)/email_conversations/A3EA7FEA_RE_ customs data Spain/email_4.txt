Hello Jennie 

Thank you for reaching out ! 

 

It seems that the automatic data refresh scheduling is not working as expected. 

 

As a result, the data was not up to date and required a manual refresh. 

 

Now, the data is displayed correctly in the tradematrix.

 

We are currently working on fixing the issue with the automatic refresh scheduling, and it should be resolved soon.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

 

Best regards

Hello,

 

The tradematrix is only showing data through Nov-24 (see 2nd screenshot below). The details says that Dec-24 is available. Do you know why it is not showing up?
