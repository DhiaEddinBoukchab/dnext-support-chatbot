Subject: Remove Verus Users

 

We see listed in our dashboard the users Mark Shin and Marco Sampaio. Neither of them are still employees with Verus and should be removed from our user list. I could not figure out how to do that from the User menu on the dashboard myself.

 

Please let me know if you need any additional information,
