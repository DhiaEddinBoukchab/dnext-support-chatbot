Hello , 

 

Dashboards have been added to DNEXR .


This is a list of the dashboards that are unique to BF that are now on DNEXR :

Crop > Europe  > EU Crop Benchmark 

Crop > Germany > Crop statistics 

Crop > United Kingdom > Crop Statistics

Economics > Netherland > livestock prices overheid

Please let me know if you want me to add / remove any dashboards.

 

A ticket has been created for the dev team to see if possible to implement the message when clients access the Category otherwise we can create a dashboard to display the message and make it appear when clients click on the “EU Black Fryers” Category.

Best regards,

Can u please create link (duplicate) between what is created in BlackFryers to Dnexr (dashboard)?

Here is where all the dashboards should be replicated. However, please note that only DNEXR employees can have access to it. No existing clients at this stage should have access. They should see the name but when they click it is empty or even better, it should say contact DNEXT in case you are interested or something along these lines….it is good marketing
