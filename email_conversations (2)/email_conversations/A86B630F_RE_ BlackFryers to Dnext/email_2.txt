Can u please create link (duplicate) between what is created in BlackFryers to Dnexr (dashboard)?

Here is where all the dashboards should be replicated. However, please note that only DNEXR employees can have access to it. No existing clients at this stage should have access. They should see the name but when they click it is empty or even better, it should say contact DNEXT in case you are interested or something along these lines….it is good marketing
