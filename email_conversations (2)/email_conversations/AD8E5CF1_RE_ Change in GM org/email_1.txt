Hi Saber, 

 

Would you be able to include Daniel in cc in the GM distlist ? I believe he only needs to receive the weekly commodity reports .

 

Juliette has changed role so the can be removed from the distlist. Daniel is therefore my new manager.

 

Thanks and have a good day
