but here we show two times the same graph? and no title?

either we remove one of them or we add a filter for Item 2 and we show two graphs.
i would show two graphs being by default the production and stocks.
would add the stocks to use metric in the table (Stocks/Total Use)

the chart on the bottom left is weird, not sure which is the item it shows. the filters are not controling it.
