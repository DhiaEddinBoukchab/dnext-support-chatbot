EXTERNAL EMAIL:

Max temperatures in India were 3/6° above normal during the past 2 weeks. on top of this, GEFS keeps showing high temperatures going above 30°C for the coming days in most of the key growing regions of northern India. While ECMWF shows a much more normal scenario, so far it seems GEFS has been the most accurate of the two. So far there is no damage done on crops and as the attached pictures of wheat plots in Uttar Pradesh show, fields are in good conditions.

 

it seems that this, plus the midterms maps also showing high temps is enough to raise concerns and think that the crop can  go to 105/110mmt. At this levels, according to our SND we are do not need to add imports but market will likely talk about this again, even more if we see the prices moving up again. so for now we keep this as a flag and will continue to monitor temperatures especially once we start to have a view of temperatures during March.

 

Some more details:

 

*	The wheat crop is at grain filling stage in the central regions of the country  which represent ~25/30% of the crop. in this region, where we have the states of  Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, harvest happens 1 month earlier than other regions and the crop is expected to hit the market by early March.

*	In the northern states of Uttar Pradesh (~35mmt crop), Punjab (15/18mmt), Haryana (10/12mmt), Rajasthan (~10mmt) and Bihar (~6mmt),  the crop harvest starts Mid April onwards and the crop is left out in the sun in the mid of rising temperatures. this is the risky region.

*	Pictures attached are as of last week un Uttar Pradesh. Crops are looking fine and not showing sigs of stress

*	Acreage is higher this year and planting was done in time (Different from what we saw during 2022 season). Reason why to expect a lowed impact than in 2022 (10/15% yield reduction which took the crop down from 115/120mmt expected to 100mmt)

*	Minimum temperatures are not above normal so far, meaning that temps are lower during the night. Official Meteo office is showing the same in their maps (see below).
