Hello Abir,

 

I hope you are doing well.

 

You should now be able to import notebooks and publish files in the DNEXR environment.

*	Regarding the Customs Dataset: you can fetch it using the API within the notebook. Please note that because the dataset is quite large, the fetching might take time. For large datasets like this, in the ‘Download a dataset’ API script, please consider increasing the wait time (for example, change wait_time < 10 to wait_time < 20).
*	For data processing, you can handle this within the notebook once the data is fetched.
*	For visualization, please use the libraries I listed in my previous email. If there are any other crucial libraries that need to be added, please let us know.

 

Attached you will find two pdfs showcasing the use of the DNEXT API one for authentication, and the other for fetching a dataset

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

 

Best regards,

Hello Saber,

Following my discussion with Guillaume and Asfoury yesterday, here are the main points:

1.	Data Retrieval: Read the 'Customs all' dataset via API from the Dnext platform.

2.	Data Processing: Process this data to prepare the DataFrame that will be used for visualizations. The processing script should be hosted and executed directly on the Dnext platform.

3.	Visualisation: The visualisation functions should also be available and callable within the Dnext platform environment.

 

Best regards,

Hello Saber,

 

I’m having trouble understanding the process after importing the notebook to the Dnext platform. As I understand it, I should be able to review and update the notebook if needed. However, in my case, I can’t find the notebook I uploaded.

Additionally, when I try to access the file generated by the notebook, I receive an error message and am unable to download it.



 

I'm working in Dnexr environment.

 

Regarding the script, the goal is to keep the notebook clean by minimizing the amount of code inside it. I plan to define the core functions in a separate Python file and import them into the notebook. This way, the notebook focuses only on visualizations.

 

 

Best regards,

Hello Abir,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

I have just tested the import notebook on my end, and it appears to be working fine. Could you please provide more details about the issue? This will help us troubleshoot more effectively.

 

Did the problem occur in your environment(resound), or on the dnexr environment?

*        flask==3.1.0

*        fuzzywuzzy==0.18.0

Hello,

 

I encountered an issue regarding importing a notebook, I think there is a bug: When I import a notebook I don't get any error and there is no result so notebook is not imported.. weird!

 

Question: If I want to integrate scripts within my notebook how i can integrate that?

 

Best regards,
