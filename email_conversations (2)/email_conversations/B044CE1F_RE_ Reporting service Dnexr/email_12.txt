Hello Saber,
Following my discussion with Guillaume and Asfoury yesterday, here are the main points:

1.	
	Data Retrieval: Read the 'Customs all' dataset via API from the Dnext platform.

2.	
	Data Processing: Process this data to prepare the DataFrame that will be used for visualizations. The processing script should be hosted and executed directly on the Dnext platform.
3.	
	Visualisation: The visualisation functions should also be available and callable within the Dnext platform environment.


Best regards,
Abir Chebbi

Hello Saber,

 

I’m having trouble understanding the process after importing the notebook to the Dnext platform. As I understand it, I should be able to review and update the notebook if needed. However, in my case, I can’t find the notebook I uploaded.

Additionally, when I try to access the file generated by the notebook, I receive an error message and am unable to download it.



 

I'm working in Dnexr environment.

 

Regarding the script, the goal is to keep the notebook clean by minimizing the amount of code inside it. I plan to define the core functions in a separate Python file and import them into the notebook. This way, the notebook focuses only on visualizations.

 

 

Best regards,

Hello Abir,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

I have just tested the import notebook on my end, and it appears to be working fine. Could you please provide more details about the issue? This will help us troubleshoot more effectively.

 

Did the problem occur in your environment(resound), or on the dnexr environment?

 

Regarding your question about integrating scripts, I didn’t fully understand it. However, for now, you can write scripts just like you would in a local Jupyter notebook. The following libraries are currently available on the platform:

*        boto3==1.36.20

*        flask==3.1.0

*        fuzzywuzzy==0.18.0

*        geobr==0.2.0

*        gunicorn==23.0.0

*        isoweek==1.3.3

*        jupyter==1.1.1

*        kaleido==0.2.1

*        matplotlib==3.7.5

*        nbconvert==7.16.6

*        numpy==1.24.4

*        pandas==2.0.3

*        pandoc==2.4

*        plotly==6.0.0

*        requests==2.32.3

*        scikit-learn==1.5.0

*        scipy==1.10.1

*        seaborn==0.13.2

*        snowflake-connector-python[pandas]==3.13.2

*        statsmodels==0.14.1

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding. I look forward to your response.

Hello,

 

I encountered an issue regarding importing a notebook, I think there is a bug: When I import a notebook I don't get any error and there is no result so notebook is not imported.. weird!

 

Question: If I want to integrate scripts within my notebook how i can integrate that?

 

Best regards,
