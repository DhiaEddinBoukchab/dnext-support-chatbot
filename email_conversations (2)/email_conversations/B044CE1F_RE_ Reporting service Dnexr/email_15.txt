Hello Abir,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

I have just tested the import notebook on my end, and it appears to be working fine. Could you please provide more details about the issue? This will help us troubleshoot more effectively.

 

Did the problem occur in your environment(resound), or on the dnexr environment?

 

Regarding your question about integrating scripts, I didn’t fully understand it. However, for now, you can write scripts just like you would in a local Jupyter notebook. The following libraries are currently available on the platform:

*	boto3==1.36.20
*	flask==3.1.0
*	fuzzywuzzy==0.18.0
*	geobr==0.2.0
*	gunicorn==23.0.0
*	isoweek==1.3.3
*	jupyter==1.1.1
*	kaleido==0.2.1
*	matplotlib==3.7.5
*	nbconvert==7.16.6
*	numpy==1.24.4
*	pandas==2.0.3
*	pandoc==2.4
*	plotly==6.0.0
*	requests==2.32.3
*	scikit-learn==1.5.0
*	scipy==1.10.1
*	seaborn==0.13.2

Hello,

 

I encountered an issue regarding importing a notebook, I think there is a bug: When I import a notebook I don't get any error and there is no result so notebook is not imported.. weird!

 

Question: If I want to integrate scripts within my notebook how i can integrate that?

 

Best regards,

Abir Chebbi
