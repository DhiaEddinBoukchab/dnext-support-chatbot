Hello Philippe,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

We would like to inform you that the fixes to the ‘Raw Sugar Tradeflow’ have been completed. You can now easily differentiate between actual values and forecasted values when downloading the data, by using the ‘Forecast’ column.

*	If the value in the ‘Forecast’ column is TRUE, it indicates that the row contains a forecasted value.
*	If the value in the ‘Forecast’ column is FALSE, it indicates that the row contains an actual value.
*	You can also distinguish the actual values and the forecasted values when visualizing the trade matrix (see the image below for visual aid)
