Hello , 

 

Is there a file for monthly data or we just sum the values that are in the same month ?

also noticed in the source that some of the data is monthly and we are mapping the value period as “WEEK” for all the data

 



 

 

 

Also for the column adding we need to pass by the dev team for that the easiest way is to create a new dataset

Best regards,

Dear Customer Support Team,

 

Verbio client is asking whether it is possible either to:

*	Add a column with the monthly data
*	Or, create a new dataset with monthly data

Whichever is easiest for you.
