Hi Pablo,

We have had a bit of a change on the wheat desk our end.

Can we pls add Rowan to the distribution list (rowan.sargeant@graincorp.com.au <mailto:rowan.sargeant@graincorp.com.au> ) of the wheat email.

Can we please remove Simon Varley from the distribution list as he has retired and left the business.

Thanks, Sam
