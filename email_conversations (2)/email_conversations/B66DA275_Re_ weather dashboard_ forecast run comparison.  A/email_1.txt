Hi Pablo,
We haven’t changed anything in the process. 
You're right, I reviewed other dashboards, and they have data up to 21-04, so it seems the issue is specific to the Black Sea data. I’ll check this with @Martin Keller <mailto:martin.keller@dnext.io> 

Example: Argentina

Hi, seems that something has changed in the way we show the actual.

before we were using the run of the GEFS (dont know which run) to complete the missing data from ERA5 until the current day. seems we are not doing that anymore and the graph looks not ok.

possible to have the same as what we had before?
