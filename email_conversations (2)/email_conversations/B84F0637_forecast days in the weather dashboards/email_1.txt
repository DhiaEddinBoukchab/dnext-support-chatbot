Dates we show in the forecasts:

in short, i think we should be showing 5 days blocks but we are starting from the t+1 where t is the forecast run date.

in the case below im selecting the run of the 21st and the 1-5 goes from the 22 to the 26 (5 days)

then the 6-10 goes from the 26th till the 1st  (5 days)

but then the 11-15 only has 4 days, which does not seem correct.

this leads to some inconsistencies when we compare vs other sources.






11-15 should be 5 days:
