Hello Pablo,
Please set a fixed day each week to update the files in the client environment. Currently, we update them every Thursday. Last week, we updated the files on Thursday, but it seems they were updated afterward. If you update the files during the week (in case of emergency), please let us know so we can update them in the client’s Dropbox as well.
Thanks,
Jebrane

Hola Pablo como estas?

 

Estoy trabajando con global wheat BS y note que algunos de los valores del archivo que esta en  DNEXT File Sharing sharepoint no coinciden con el ultimo reporte que enviaste el 21st march.

 

Por ejemplo en el reporte 24/25 Aus production esta en 33.4 y el archivo lo tiene en 31.8. Calculo que no fue actualizado. Para el 25/26 parece que esta bien.

 



 

Cuando puedas míralo,

Gracias!
