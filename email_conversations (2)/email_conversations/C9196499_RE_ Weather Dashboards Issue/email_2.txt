Subject: Weather Dashboards Issue

 

Hello,

 

I would like to report two additional bugs I've encountered on the weather dashboard. These may be related to the button disappearing issue I reported over the weekend.

 

Bug #1: Graph Button Becomes Unresponsive

When attempting to click on the graph option, the button becomes grayed out and unresponsive. I am unable to click on it or access the graph functionality.

Steps to Reproduce:

*	Navigate to the weather dashboard
*	Attempt to click on the graph option button
*	Observe that the button becomes grayed out and non-functional

 

 





 

Bug #2: Inconsistent Default Country Selection

The default view for country selection is not consistent between different weather dashboards. Each dashboard shows different default countries selected, creating an inconsistent user experience.

 

Louis
