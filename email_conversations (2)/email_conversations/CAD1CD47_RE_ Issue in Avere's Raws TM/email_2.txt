Hello Support Team!

Avere has reported an issue concerning the "Raw Sugar Trade flow", despite the data seems to be flowing well on our view, Avere's portal is missing October 2025 Numbers. 
This is our view on Dnexr


And this is Avere's View


 

Can you please check what would be the matter? 

 

Thank you in advance!
