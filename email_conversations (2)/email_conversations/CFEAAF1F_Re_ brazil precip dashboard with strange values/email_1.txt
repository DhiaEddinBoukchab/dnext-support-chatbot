Hello, 

Me and Martin we were Analysing the Issue, and now normally all is good, except the Weird values for 25-Feb(We're working on it now)
But the rest is fixed for Precipitation and temperature.



Thanks, 
Jebrane.

Subject: brazil precip dashboard with strange values 
 
Hi, i think there is something weird here once the user selects the following.

happens the same if ECMWF is selected. talking with Lucas, it seems something is not ok.

can we check the brazil dashboards? temperature is also showing crazy values
