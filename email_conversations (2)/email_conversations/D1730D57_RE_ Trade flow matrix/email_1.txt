Hello Michel

Thank you for reaching out with your question about the duplicate Tradematrixes. I understand how this might seem confusing, so here’s a quick explanation:

We recently upgraded our sharing system to improve how access to resources is managed.

This new system ensures that your access to the latest Tradematrixes is always up to date.

Here’s how to identify which Tradematrix to use:

1.	New Format: Tradematrixes with the code format "ameropa-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" are part of the new sharing system. 

These are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in access or content, ensuring you always have the latest version.

	*	Dynamic Updates: With this new sharing system, if there are any changes or updates to the resources, your access will be updated automatically and dynamically. This means you don’t have to worry about outdated versions or manually requesting updates.

1.	Old Format: Tradematrixes with the code format "dnexr-xxxx-xxxx" were shared using our previous system. We will be phasing these out soon, so we recommend transitioning to the new format.

To avoid confusion, please start using the Tradematrixes /datasets that have this code format "ameropa-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx". 

The older versions will be removed shortly as we fully adopt the new system.

We sent an email earlier about this update, but you might have missed it. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Saber Khalfallah
