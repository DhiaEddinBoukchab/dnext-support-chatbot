Hello ,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

We experienced an outage in the environment hosting our weather and satellite data pipelines last night. The issue has been fully resolved, and all pipelines are now running normally.

 

Some data pipelines, such as ERA5-Land, are currently backfilling. All missing data is expected to be available within the next hour, and we will let you know once it is fully available again.

 

We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding.

 

Best regards,
