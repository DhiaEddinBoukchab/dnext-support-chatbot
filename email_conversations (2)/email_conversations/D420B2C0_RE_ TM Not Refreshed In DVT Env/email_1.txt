Hello Mohamed,

 

It is setup to refresh automatically on dnexr every day at 9 AM 

And by extension it should refresh on DVT automatically.

 



 

Which is working as far as I can see .

 



 

Or is it something else you mean ?

 

Best regards,

Hi, 

 

The raw sugar trade matrix is not refreshed in the client's (DVT) environment even though it has been refreshed on DNEXR, not sure if it is a bug or a problem with the sharing contract 

 

Best,
