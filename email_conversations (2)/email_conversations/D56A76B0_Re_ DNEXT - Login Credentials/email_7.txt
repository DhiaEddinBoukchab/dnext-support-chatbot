Hi Saber, 

 

I can’t find a lot of data on the portal. 

 

So yes, a demo would be great. Rajesh Would be happy to attend it tomorrow. Please let us know what time works for you. Anytime post 2pm IST works best for us, but we are flexible. 

 

Request you to use my tria login for demo. We have not changed the password. 

 

Rajesh is copied on this email. 

 

Thanks
