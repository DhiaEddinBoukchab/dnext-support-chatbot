================================================================================

Hi guys, would it be possible to add the following changes:




1.	
	in the panel views, leave this selection as default. (@Lucas Rosa <mailto:lucas.rosa@dnext.io>  / @Guillaume Goudy <mailto:guillaume.goudy@dnext.io>  agree?)

this would make the map look a bit clearer and then if needed the user selects the other regions





2.	
	In Ukraine we need to have regional breakdown as we have for Russia. Breakdown is attached in the excel file.
3.	
	in the soil moisture and snow cover dashboard can we add the same regional breakdown for both Russia and Ukraine?
