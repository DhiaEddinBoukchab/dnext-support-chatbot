Subject: Customs BILATERAL issues on data

 

In the process of the creation of the tradeflowWatch, we are merging the bilateral customs.

 

Currently starting with:

Https://dnexr.dnext.io/datasets/dnexr-eurostat-all-eur-tf-customs-bilateral-monthly 

https://dnexr.dnext.io/datasets/dnexr-un-comtrade-all-world-tf-customs-bilateral-monthly

Currency is missing for comtrade

Unit is often missing (mostly N/A)

 

I see additional fields Bilateral for comtrade:



 

It should use category extra fields. What to do with them ?
