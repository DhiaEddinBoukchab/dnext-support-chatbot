Soybean – Planting Progress and Field Conditions


Planting Progress

*	Soybean planting reaches 44.7%, after an 8.7 p.p. weekly advance.
*	Planting remains behind last year by 9 p.p. and 1 p.p. below the average of the last five seasons.

Regional Dynamics

*	In both core regions, first-crop soybean seeding is nearing completion.
*	In Central Buenos Aires, excessive soil moisture continues to hinder machinery access, slowing planting progress.
*	Second-crop soybean planting begins to accelerate, especially in core areas, supported by advancing wheat and barley harvests.

 

 


Corn – Steady Expansion of Late-Planting Window


Planting Progress

*	Corn planting continues progressing with the development of the late-season planting window, reaching 44% of the national target, a weekly progress of +4.7 p.p. and +8.18 vs 5 year average

Crop and Soil Conditions

*	86% of planted corn remains in Good to Excellent condition and Normal to Excellent Conditions are stable at 100%
*	Soil moisture conditions are highly favorable nationwide, with 94% of planted areas falling between Adequate and Optimal.
*	Localized excess moisture persists in the Southern Core and parts of central Buenos Aires, though impacts remain limited and do not alter the overall positive outlook.

 


Wheat – Strong Yields Maintain Record-Level Outlook


 

*                     Crop estimates:

o        Our estimates are stable at 23.8 MMT

o        The Bolsa de Cereales estimates are stable at 25.5 MMT.

o        The Rosario Grain Exchange estimates are stable at 24.5 MMT.

Harvest Progress:

*	Wheat harvest now covers 45.3% of eligible area, after an 11.4 p.p. weekly increase and 5 p.p. ahead of the 5-year average.

Yield Performance and Field Status:

*	The harvest moves forward at a normal pace across central regions, with yields ranging 3.5-5.9 Tons/Ha on average, except in isolated hail-affected lots.
*	Of the remaining standing crop, 73% has already reached physiological maturity, while the remaining 27% in the grain-filling stage is located mainly in the southern production belt, where soil moisture remains Adequate to Optimal in over 90% of fields.
