Hello,

The script has been fixed; however, there is currently a bug in the workflow. Our dev team is actively working on resolving it.
This is the ticket link : https://dnext.atlassian.net/browse/DNP-6508?search_id=b7a7d8ad-d2eb-4488-ba7d-34fc8c8e991e <https://dnext.atlassian.net/browse/DNP-6508?search_id=b7a7d8ad-d2eb-4488-ba7d-34fc8c8e991e> 

Best,

Well noted and thank you for having looked at it in details.
I will look at the new version and check if I find the numbers already in the dataset, to make sure this is still the right source.
Will do that on Monday.

Hello @Jebrane Ben Salem <mailto:jebrane.bensalem@dnext.io> ,
It appears that the source has completely changed its publication structure. Previously, the data was provided as a ZIP file containing multiple folders, each with several files per commodity and full historical coverage.
The source now publishes a single Excel file that only includes the latest figures and follows a different data structure.
As a result, this cannot be fixed today, as both the code and the underlying logic need to be reworked. 
@Nour Meddeb <mailto:nour.meddeb@dnext.io>  will adjust this next week after verifying the new structure with Quentin.

Dear Support team,

Could you please check and repair the workflow associated to the dnexr-agreste-grains-fra-snd-item-yearly dataset ?

The first step, "extract" is in error.

Thanks in advance for your help on this

Regards,
