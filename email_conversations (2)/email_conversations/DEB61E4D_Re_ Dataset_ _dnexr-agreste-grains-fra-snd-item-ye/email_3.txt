Hello @Jebrane Ben Salem <mailto:jebrane.bensalem@dnext.io> ,
It appears that the source has completely changed its publication structure. Previously, the data was provided as a ZIP file containing multiple folders, each with several files per commodity and full historical coverage.
The source now publishes a single Excel file that only includes the latest figures and follows a different data structure.
As a result, this cannot be fixed today, as both the code and the underlying logic need to be reworked. 
@Nour Meddeb <mailto:nour.meddeb@dnext.io>  will adjust this next week after verifying the new structure with Quentin.

Dear Support team,

Could you please check and repair the workflow associated to the dnexr-agreste-grains-fra-snd-item-yearly dataset ?

The first step, "extract" is in error.

Thanks in advance for your help on this
