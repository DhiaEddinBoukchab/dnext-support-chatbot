A big mess is the best word to summarize it. 

We have several times Europe…See TAXUD is the same…not sure which one to look at and it is in DNEXR

Then, we still do not have USA there. We just need to transfer it from its existing place (see second graph). Please keep original but haromonize with the others as well.
