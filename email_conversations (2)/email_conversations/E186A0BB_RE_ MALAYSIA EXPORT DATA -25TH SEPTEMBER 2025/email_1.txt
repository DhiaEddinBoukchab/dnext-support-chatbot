Hello Bastien,

The difference comes from some vessels that were present in the report received on September 15th but are missing in the latest update






Additionally, one vessel had a delay in its ETS, which caused it to be counted twice and created a duplicate. we will deal with it .
for the Products we have this list:

 

should we map it all as Fatty Acid ?

Best regards,

Hello,

 

This contains 1288kmt for the month of September. The dataset in the platform shows 1364.

Can you check why and make the correction please ?

Also, I see in the dataset, 36kt which is mapped to “Not Available”, Id be keen to understand which products aren’t mapped.

 

Thanks
