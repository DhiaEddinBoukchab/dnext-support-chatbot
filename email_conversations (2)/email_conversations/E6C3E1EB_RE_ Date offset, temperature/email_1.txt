Yes, please look into it because there is definitely a problem.

Another argument : into my place the temps reach the peak on Monday 14th of July with rains. The next 2 days temps drops as per Meteo France website.

The model ECMWF in the platform shows the peak of temps on the 13th instead, and the 2 cool days being Monday / Tuesday instead.

 



 

If I look at ECMWF website itself :

9th July 0Z run – I suppose it is operational though, but shows 28-32 on the 14th July.

 



 

The next day 15th July it is 20-24 range.

Is this a case of ECMWF ensemble forecast getting the transition away from the heatwave in northern France wrong then?

 

For reference, London woke up to miserable weather on the 2nd, so it’s not unthinkable that the forecast model misplaced an air mass boundary for that forecast.

 

If you’d like I can dig into the details a bit more to confirm that this is indeed what the ensemble model was up on that day.

Well – you took the screenshot after it refreshed and considered the 2nd July 0Z GFS as official data.

So if you want to keep seeing the problem, you can go in “Forecast Run Comparison” and select the ECMWF ENS 1st July 12Z.

There it is 24.68 for the 2nd of July…

Hello guys,

 

I can tell you that this is wrong. Maybe a date offset. Im dying here with the temps, it is not 24.7 degrees
