Hello Mateo,

 

Thank you for reaching out to us ,

 

We are currently investigating the issue with the download button not showing up in the Barley TradeMatrix and will let you know as soon as it's fixed.

 

Attached you will find the file for the barley tradematrix.

 

Regarding the total Wheat Tradeflow , you can find it by navigating to the Wheat Aggregation TradeMatrix. I checked on my end and this one displays the download button and is  functioning correctly here is the link below :

Please let me know if the download button doesn't work on your end, and I can send you the total Wheat TradeMatrix file.



 

We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your patience and understanding.

 

If you have any other questions or inquiries, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Hello Saber,

 

Thanks for your help.

 

Im having the same issue with Barley, even with the “graincorp-xxxx-xxxx" format. Can’t find the download button. If possible can you please forward me that data as soon as possible, we have a presentation on Monday and need to work out few details. 

 

On the wheat hand, the one that you are showing below is flour wheat, not total wheat. If possible, I will also need total wheat tradeflow data

 

Cheers,

Mateo

Hello Mateo,

 

You can consult the Wheat Flour TradeMatrix via the following link:

 

https://graincorp.dnext.io/fundamentals/tradematrix/graincorp-f768cc0f-d786-4e35-80a2-c9001e617cd9

 

The download button is available and fully functional on it.

 



 

Please note that TradeMatrix with codes in the format "dnexr-xxxx-xxxx" (which were shared via our old system) will be removed soon.

 

Also there are some issues with them such as the one you encountered (the download button not showing )

 

We recommend using TradeMatrix with codes in the "graincorp-xxxx-xxxx" format, as these are trade flows shared via our new system. 

 

This ensures that any updates or changes to resources will be dynamically reflected in your access.

 



Please Let us know if you have any questions, or if you need any assistance

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding 

 

Best regards,
