Hello Mateo,

 

You can consult the Wheat Flour TradeMatrix via the following link:

 

https://graincorp.dnext.io/fundamentals/tradematrix/graincorp-f768cc0f-d786-4e35-80a2-c9001e617cd9

 

The download button is available and fully functional on it.

 



 

Please note that TradeMatrix with codes in the format "dnexr-xxxx-xxxx" (which were shared via our old system) will be removed soon.

 

Also there are some issues with them such as the one you encountered (the download button not showing )

 

We recommend using TradeMatrix with codes in the "graincorp-xxxx-xxxx" format, as these are trade flows shared via our new system. 

 

This ensures that any updates or changes to resources will be dynamically reflected in your access.

 



Please Let us know if you have any questions, or if you need any assistance

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding 

 

Best regards,
