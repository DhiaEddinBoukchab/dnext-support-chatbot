Hello Roberto,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

We’re currently unable to access the US grain inspections update due to an issue with the source’s download servers. 

 

Once their servers are back up and running, we will update the data and notify you immediately.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Hi Saber,

 

Hope all is going well. 

 

Can you pls let us know once the US grain inspections update is available (code 'thul-2080b4c3-7f87-4132-aeef-68ec3b92d8ca') in the database? 

I’d be curious to understand why the update schedule is so irregular for this data, can we schedule a trigger that runs once the report is published? I’m usually testing a few times until the data is available.

 

Thanks
