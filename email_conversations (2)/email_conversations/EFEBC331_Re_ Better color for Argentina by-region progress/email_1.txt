Thanks for you feedback Oscar.

Regarding the regions Vs provinces unfortunately will be hard to covert, due to the crop conditions is given by BAGR using those regions, if they have by city we could convert, but last time I checked they doesn’t have this.

Over the map colors need to change! We will take this ASAP. By Monday should be ready.

Hi Support Team,

I've always found the Argentina crop "regions" difficult to track in my head. (Provinces are easier for me.)  So, I was happy to see that your platform mapped the crop progress to those regions!

However, while your color choice of red vs green is intended to denote low vs high, in practice negative numbers are coded green (example below). That makes your maps difficult to read: for example, it's difficult for me to see which regions are behind the Average.

Could you either (1) show a legend next to each map indicating which color represents 0, or (2) modify your color map so that 0 is shown as a (fixed) neutral color?



Let me know if I didn't make myself clear. Happy to discuss more.
Oscar
