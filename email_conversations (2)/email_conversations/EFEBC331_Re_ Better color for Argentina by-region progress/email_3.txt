Hi Support Team,

I've always found the Argentina crop "regions" difficult to track in my head. (Provinces are easier for me.)  So, I was happy to see that your platform mapped the crop progress to those regions!

However, while your color choice of red vs green is intended to denote low vs high, in practice negative numbers are coded green (example below). That makes your maps difficult to read: for example, it's difficult for me to see which regions are behind the Average.

Could you either (1) show a legend next to each map indicating which color represents 0, or (2) modify your color map so that 0 is shown as a (fixed) neutral color?



Let me know if I didn't make myself clear. Happy to discuss more.
