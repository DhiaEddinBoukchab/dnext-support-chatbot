Hello,

 

I hope you're doing well.

 

I’ve noticed a few issues in the Soil Moisture section of the Weather Dashboard and wanted to check if these changes are expected:

 

The date displayed in the title seems off.

 

The date filter used to start from January 1st, if I’m not mistaken—it now appears to behave differently.

 

On the dashboard landing page, Finland and Norway are shown now, whereas only usefull part of Sweden used to be shown.

 

Please find attached a screenshot from earlier this week for reference, and some screenshots of what I encountered.

 

Could you confirm whether these changes are intentional or if something needs to be fixed?

 

Thanks in advance for your help.

 

Best regards,

 

Louis
