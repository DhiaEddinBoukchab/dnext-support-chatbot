PRECIPITATION & CORN PLANTING PACE:  Rains over the weekend was concentrated over north Santa-Fé (was needed) and central south Buenos Aires received heavy rains again, however planting season should be just starting over there, so no impacts over the crops. Core part of the belt received scattered rains. Forecast has almost completely dry next 10 days, favoring the planting pace, that was reported 6% last Thursday.
