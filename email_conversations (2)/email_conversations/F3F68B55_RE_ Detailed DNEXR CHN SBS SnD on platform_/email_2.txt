Hello Oscar,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

Regarding your request, we currently do not display those items on the dashboards if that’s what you mean.

 

But we will add them shortly, we will let you know once it’s ready.

 

besides the Carry Out import, is there any other item that you would like to see on the Oilseeds Dashboard?

 

Best regards,

Subject: Detailed DNEXR CHN SBS SnD on platform?

 

Hi Saber,

 

Re: CHN SBS SnD, does the platform currently show some of those detailed line items such as "Carry Out Import" on a monthly basis?

 

As China's commercial inventory tightens from now till the next Brazil crop arrives in early 2026, we hope to closely monitor the monthly evolutions of commercial (as well as state reserve stocks).

 



 

By the way, I know that your API contains those detailed line items and I was indeed able to access them. So my question here is just about whether I can directly view the same data via the Platform.
