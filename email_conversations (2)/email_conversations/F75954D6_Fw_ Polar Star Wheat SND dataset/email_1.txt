Hi Pablo

 

I hope you’re doing well.

 

I wanted to check if you add the Wheat SND data to the relevant polarstar dataset that we can pull via the API?

I see in the excel file where we get the wheat SND data, there is also wheat by class data. Could we also get that data through the API in addition to the total wheat figures?

Thanks

 

Regards
