Hello Saber,

 

Many thanks for sharing the details of the current dataset.

 

Yes, could you please include cotton in the mix? Let me know if you have any questions regarding USDA’s reporting format for cotton. Once cotton is added, will it also update with future reports?

Hello Roberto,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

We do have a dataset with historical data dating back to 1995; however, it currently includes only Corn, Soybeans, and Wheat. Cotton data has not been included so far, as there hasn't been any prior request for it.

 

Dataset Code : thul-7431afe6-5b54-11ef-891d-026031473607

 

If you require cotton data, we can certainly collect and add it to the dataset. Please let us know if you would like us to proceed, and we will inform you as soon as it's available.

 

Best regards,

Subject: US planted and harvested estimates

 

Hi Saber,

 

Hope that you’re doing well!

 

We’re looking for historical (2000-2024) USDA’s acreage estimates (planted & harvested) for US corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton.

 

We’ve seen that USDA’s quickstats database has this data, but unfortunately they only provide a few recent years in database format.

 

I suspect that Dnext has already cleaned this data, could you please let us know if there is an existing dataset with this info? We need the state and national level estimates reported in USDA’s March survey (March estimate), the June survey (June estimate) and the final estimates.

 

 

Thanks for the help,
