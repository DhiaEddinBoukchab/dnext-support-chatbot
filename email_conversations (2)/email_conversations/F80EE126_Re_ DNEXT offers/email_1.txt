Hello Oscar,

 

Regarding the crop tour in general today we cover 3 major areas for soybean & Corn in South America and USA, below you will find an example where the red dots are field samples and for Brazil is the samples that we already have collected for soybean 2025.

 

The crop tour is made with some partners like Viterra, Zenohgrain, BTG, Olam, CHS, Nova Agri, Inpasa and others. 

 

It is collected plant or ear population, grains per plant, diseases, plagues and any other relevant information about the crop conditions and expectations. After that the differential is to have a large history like Mato Grosso (image below), so with this history we can adjust the crop yield based on hard information/data.

 

The calendar about crop tours is:

1.	Soybean Brazil – From Early January to Final March.
2.	Winter Corn Brazil – May and June
3.	Corn & Soybean Argentina – March, this year we will go at March 17th 
4.	USA Final July, Early August.

Please

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Best regards,
