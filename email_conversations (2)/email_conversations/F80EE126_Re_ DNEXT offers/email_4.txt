Hi Bastien and Guillaume,

 

Thank you again for your introduction today. Sorry we had to walk out abruptly towards the end. I didn't get a chance to ask you two follow-up questions:

 

1. Re: Brazil crop tour - Could you tell us a bit more about it?

 

2. Re: API to your Platform - Do you have an API documentation that you could share?

 

Thank you again,
