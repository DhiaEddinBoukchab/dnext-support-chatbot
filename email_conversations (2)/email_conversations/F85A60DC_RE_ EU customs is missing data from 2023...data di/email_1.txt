Subject: RE: EU customs is missing data from 2023...data disappeared. Thank you to let me knowwhen it is fixed

 

its due to potential bugs in the platform : 

 

we did a reapply mapping to fix the "BUCKWHEAT" thing , and it deleted 3 million rows. 

 

Also when running the dataprep the workflow is stuck at the loading step.

 

For now we will revert the dataset to it's previous version hence "BUCKWHEAT" will return , dashboard is still refreshing it should not take long before it displays the data

 

it could also probably be because of the addition of the new columns

 

we will investigate this along with the dev team and let you know as soon as it’s fixed
