Subject: How to use hierarchy of products and countries
Message-ID: GV0P278MB02103C3A3C23694808F9EB9F9211A@GV0P278MB0210.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM

================================================================================

Hello,
I would like to use a dataset from Dnexr that lists all the country groups (e.g., the list of countries in the EU-27).
Is there a similar dataset for products as well?
If not, how can I use reference data to retrieve the hierarchy of products and countries via an API?

Thanks,
Abir Chebbi
