Hi,

 

Hope all is well. I was wondering if anything has changed on the DNEXR datasets download – before it seems that when I clicked Download, I could download the latest updated file, vs. this time it shows a whole zipped folder. 

DNEXT - Datasets <https://cresource.dnext.io/datasets/cresource-4c8d416c-7f52-4f39-8643-a386e4c3a443/general> 

 



 

Specifically for DNexr oilseeds, I don’t think any of the file includes the latest updated version (Jan 2026?) or perhaps I am missing something here. 

 

Could you please kindly help me with that? 

 

Thanks,

Stella

Hi,

 

Hope all is well. Just hope check with you on one of the DNext dashboards – the India SEA stats. It does not seem like I have access to it. The link shared with me was dnexr.dnext.io/dashboard/*/SND/India/6a4da16b-3dc8-4a91-bd7b-d28de632c5a8 <https://dnexr.dnext.io/dashboard/*/SND/India/6a4da16b-3dc8-4a91-bd7b-d28de632c5a8>  – could you please kindly help me take a look? 

 

Thanks,
