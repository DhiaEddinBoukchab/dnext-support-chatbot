Hello Oscar,
Happy to hear that you’ve successfully logged in!
You can use the same username and password to access our APIs. Below is an example of how to retrieve your API token (you’ll just need to replace the placeholder with your actual password):
import json
import requests

# Login to API and get token
def connect(email, pwd, env):
    '''
    email: email used to connect to your dnext environment
    pwd: password
    env: name of your enviroment, first part in your dnext URL before the dot
    ENV.dnext.io -> env = 'ENV'
    '''
    # Login to API and get token
    url = f'https://api.dnext.io/v1.0/auth/custom-login?org={env}'
   
    payload = json.dumps({
        'email': f'{email}',
        'password': f'{pwd}',
        'organization': f'{env}'
    })

    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    token = response.json()['token']
    return token
   
token = connect('oshi@valentassetmgmt.com', 'Password', 'vam')
print(token)
You’ll also find in the two attached PDFs instructions on how to download a dataset or Tradeflow using the API.
If you'd prefer a quick walkthrough, our customer support team is available to schedule a call and guide you through using the API and extracting data from datasets or Tradeflows.
Let me know if you’d like to set that up!
Best regards,
Jebrane
