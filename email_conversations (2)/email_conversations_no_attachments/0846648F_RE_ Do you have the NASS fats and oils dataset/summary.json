    "solution": "The platform initially provided access to the soybean oil data from the NASS report via a specific dataset link. Subsequently, the platform updated the dataset to include all oils from the NASS fats and oils report, making the complete dataset accessible through the same link: https://vags.dnext.io/datasets/vags-cb148487-4c48-11f0-8b51-02abcd39fb87/data-exploration. Users can access this link to explore monthly production and stock data for soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, and other oils as reported in the NASS fats and oils report.",
