Hello,
Concerning the creation of the TF, should it be done on dnexr then shared with them? Should it be created directly on their environment? What countries do they have access to ( to include them as exporters in the TF) ?
Waiting for your response,
Best,
Khalil.

This is for TF team. Let me know if you have any questions. 

He means you need to create a TF with corn, ddgs, sorghum...you need to ask him which commodity he wants to add? Wheat and Barley are tricky as we do not have a TF split for feed and milling. Pablo, any idea?
