Hi Lucas,

 

Yes, it would be great to have the weekly delivery data in the dash. I would suggest 2 seasonal charts, one showing the weekly deliveries and the second chart showing it cumulative. Similar to the farmer selling charts I guess, as the important point to monitor is both weekly arrivals but also season-to-date.

 

Thanks and regards
