	Hi Misha

	 

	We are sorry to hear that you're having trouble receiving the verification code. 

	 

	Let's get this sorted out. It’s possible the email might be getting sent to your junk or spam folder. 

	 

	Here's how you can whitelist our email address to ensure future emails come through without issues:

	 

	For Outlook Desktop:

	1.	Open Outlook and click on the Home tab.
	2.	Click on Junk in the toolbar and select Junk E-mail Options.
	3.	In the window that pops up, go to the Safe Senders tab.
	4.	Click Add and enter “noreply@dnext.io <mailto:noreply@dnext.io> ” 
	5.	Click OK to save.

	 

	For Outlook Web (Outlook.com):

	 

	Log in to Outlook.com.

	 

	1.	Log in to your Outlook.com account.

	 

	2.	Click the gear icon (Settings) in the top-right corner and select "View all Outlook settings".

	 

	3.	Go to Mail > Junk email.

	 

	4.	Under Safe senders and domains, click "Add" and enter noreply@dnext.io <mailto:noreply@dnext.io>  to whitelist.

	 

	5.	Click Save.

	 

	 

	In addition, please note that our IT team has already been informed and is currently investigating the situation on our end to ensure everything is working smoothly.

	 

	Once you've whitelisted our email address, you should start receiving our verification emails without any issues.
