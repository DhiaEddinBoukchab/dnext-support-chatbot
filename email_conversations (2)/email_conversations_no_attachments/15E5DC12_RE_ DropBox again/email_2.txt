Hello Michel,

 

We are sorry to hear that you are still encountering issues in your Dropbox.

for the numbers with a strikethrough, mIt seems is linked to an excel upgrade. Recently they added an option under the “Formulas” tab, Calculation section, “Calculation Options”.

This is where you set “Manual” or “Automatic” calculation of formulas.

Now they have “Format stale values”, which from what I understand is formatting with a strikethrough number not re-calculated.

If you uncheck the option, it will be gone.

 

Please let me know if this solves it.

 

As for your second point. I have added all the SBS related files that are available.

 

Please let me know if you still encounter any other issues , I will be glad to assist you further.

 

Best regards,

Subject: DropBox again

 

Hello Saber,

checking again the DropBox, this is what I see:

both corn and wheat snd numbers coming with a strike on the numbers:
   

 

I did a refresh but no change:


Further to it, in the SBS folder I see only the snd_source. Is it ok?

  

Thanks in advance for your support.

FYI, I have a call  now so we can only work on it on Monday or the following days,   

Enjoy the weekend,
