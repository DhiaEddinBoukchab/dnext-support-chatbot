Hello Guillaume,
We have addressed the issue and it's fixed now.



For HealthCheck now it doesn't detect such thing, but we will request it to be added because it might be useful. 

Want me to answer Jennie or leave it to support team? 

Best regards,
Skander

We do not have a check that import/export should contain same timing? Also, frequency...We are in May....how delay is Paraguay source? It should be in the recency check. 

Thank you to scan and see what failed in our quality process.

Hello,

 

Can you look into Paraguay customs please? It is showing data through Apr-25 on the imports but the exports are only showing through Jan-25. See below screenshots. I had it on All products and All countries so it shouldn’t be a filtering issue. And it would have loaded something so can’t be that there is none.
