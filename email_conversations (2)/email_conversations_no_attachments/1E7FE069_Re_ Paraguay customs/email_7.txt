We do not have a check that import/export should contain same timing? Also, frequency...We are in May....how delay is Paraguay source? It should be in the recency check. 

Thank you to scan and see what failed in our quality process.

Hello,

 

Can you look into Paraguay customs please? It is showing data through Apr-25 on the imports but the exports are only showing through Jan-25. See below screenshots. I had it on All products and All countries so it shouldn’t be a filtering issue. And it would have loaded something so can’t be that there is none.
