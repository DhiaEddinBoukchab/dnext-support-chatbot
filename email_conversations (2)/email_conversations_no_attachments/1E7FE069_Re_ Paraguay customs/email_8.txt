Hello,

 

Can you look into Paraguay customs please? It is showing data through Apr-25 on the imports but the exports are only showing through Jan-25. See below screenshots. I had it on All products and All countries so it shouldn’t be a filtering issue. And it would have loaded something so can’t be that there is none.
