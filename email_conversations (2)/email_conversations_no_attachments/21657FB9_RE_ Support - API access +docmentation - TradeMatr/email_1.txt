Hello Abir, 



I hope this email finds you well.


Attached you will find three PDFS showcasing how to use the API to fetch data from the platform ,

 

Note : for the authentication your environment is “resound”



As for the tradematrix issue can you specify which tradeMatrix you failed to visualize ,I tested on the Rice TradeMatrix and had no issue visualizing the data 




 

Note that the data might take some time to load depending on the size of it 

please let us know if this helps you out 



Looking forward to hearing from you 

 

Best regards

Hello,

 

I am encountering two issues on the Dnext platform:

 

*	API Access: I currently do not have the API option available in my account. And could you please provide documentation on how to use the API for downloading data?

*	TradeMatrix Loading Issue: The TradeMatrix is stuck in a continuous loading loop, preventing access to necessary data.

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Best regards,
