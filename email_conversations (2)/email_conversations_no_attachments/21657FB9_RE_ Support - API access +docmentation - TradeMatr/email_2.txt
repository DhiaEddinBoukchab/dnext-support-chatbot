Hello,

I am encountering two issues on the Dnext platform:


*	
	API Access: I currently do not have the API option available in my account. And could you please provide documentation on how to use the API for downloading data?
*	
	TradeMatrix Loading Issue: The TradeMatrix is stuck in a continuous loading loop, preventing access to necessary data.


Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Abir Chebbi
