**Problem**: The customer requested the setup of a contract for a new environment, massar.dnext.io, with specific access limitations and contract dates.

**Context**: The user is an external user from a Customer Organization requesting a setup for the DNEXT platform. The environment is intended for Massar Capital Management, with access limited to specific cash prices for commodities.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed sharing the necessary sections and datasets for the environment. The customer later provided two user emails for account creation, requesting a final check before the users are sent access.
