Hello Nic,

 

Compliments of the season! I hope you’re doing well.

 

You are correct,we recently introduced file compression (zipping) to optimize large downloads. While this was primarily intended for UI-triggered downloads, we are currently investigating why this is affecting your API integration.

 

We will keep you posted on our progress and any necessary adjustments to your setup

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

 

Best regards,

Hi Saber

 

Compliments of the season, I hope you’re well.

 

I’d like to ask whether there have been any changes to the API through which we pull the SND datasets? It seems the file compression has been changed/added, as opposed to csv as before if I remember correctly? 

 

Is this a once-off or will the datasets now be zipped? 

 

Regards

Nic
