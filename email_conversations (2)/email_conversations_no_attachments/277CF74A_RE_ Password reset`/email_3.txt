Hi Saber

 

Compliments of the season, I hope you’re well.

 

I’d like to ask whether there have been any changes to the API through which we pull the SND datasets? It seems the file compression has been changed/added, as opposed to csv as before if I remember correctly? 

 

Is this a once-off or will the datasets now be zipped? 

 

Regards

Nic
