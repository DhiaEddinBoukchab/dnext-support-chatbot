Hello team,
Following up on the workflow issues mentioned earlier, I wanted to provide an update on their status. Unfortunately, none of the impacted workflows have been resolved at this time.
For the workflows that failed in the load phase (Chinimandi Daily Sugar Prices, NCDEX Daily Indian Sugar Prices, DNEXR, China Future Prices), I have informed both the test and support teams. Based on their feedback, the failure appears to be related to a Snowflake error. Efforts to resolve this are currently underway.
Regarding the Fuels World Future Prices workflow, which failed during the extract phase: the script has been corrected, but the extract phase is stuck in a running loop and taking an unusually long time. Refreshing did not resolve the issue, which suggests this is likely a platform related error. This is being addressed separately.
I will continue to monitor the situation and share updates as soon as any progress is made.
Thank you for your patience.
Best regards,

Hello team,
I’d like to inform you that we are currently experiencing issues with several workflows that have failed during the load or extract phase. Specifically:

1.	
	Greenleaf Workflows

	*	
		Chinimandi Daily Sugar Prices
	*	
		NCDEX Daily Indian Sugar Prices
		These workflows failed during the load phase without an apparent reason.

2.	
	DNEXR 

	*	
		China Future Prices
		This workflow also failed in the load phase.

3.	
	Fuels World Future Prices
	    This workflow failed during the extract phase.

I will be investigating the load phase failures in coordination with the support team to identify the root cause and resolve the issue as soon as possible. Additionally, I will handle the extract phase failure for the Fuels World Future Prices workflow separately.
I will keep you updated on our progress and provide further details once the investigation is complete. 
Best regards,
