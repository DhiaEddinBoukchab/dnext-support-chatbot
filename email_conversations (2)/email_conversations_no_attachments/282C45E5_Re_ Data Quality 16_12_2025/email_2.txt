================================================================================

Hello team,
I’d like to inform you that we are currently experiencing issues with several workflows that have failed during the load or extract phase. Specifically:

1.	
	Greenleaf Workflows

	*	
		Chinimandi Daily Sugar Prices
	*	
		NCDEX Daily Indian Sugar Prices
		These workflows failed during the load phase without an apparent reason.

2.	
	DNEXR 

	*	
		China Future Prices
		This workflow also failed in the load phase.

3.	
	Fuels World Future Prices
	    This workflow failed during the extract phase.

I will be investigating the load phase failures in coordination with the support team to identify the root cause and resolve the issue as soon as possible. Additionally, I will handle the extract phase failure for the Fuels World Future Prices workflow separately.
I will keep you updated on our progress and provide further details once the investigation is complete. 
Best regards,
