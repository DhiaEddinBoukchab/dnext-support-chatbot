**Problem**: The customer reported failures in multiple workflows during the load and extract phases, specifically for the Greenleaf Workflows and Fuels World Future Prices. The failures occurred without an apparent reason, and the customer needed assistance in resolving these issues.

**Context**: The user is a Data Analyst from a Customer Organization. The issues involve workflows related to data extraction and loading processes, specifically within the Snowflake platform. The failures have been acknowledged and are being investigated in coordination with the support team.

**Solution**: The customer has informed the support and test teams about the failures, which appear to be related to a Snowflake error. While the script for the Fuels World Future Prices workflow has been corrected, it is currently stuck in a running loop. The customer is actively monitoring the situation and will provide updates as progress is made. It is recommended to further investigate the Snowflake platform for underlying issues.
