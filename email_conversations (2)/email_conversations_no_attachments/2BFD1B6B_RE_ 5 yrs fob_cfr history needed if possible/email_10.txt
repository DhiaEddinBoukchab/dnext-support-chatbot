Subject: 5 yrs fob/cfr history needed if possible

 

Dear Guillaume and Bastien,

If I were to ask for FOB and CFR historicals for corn and meal, is that feasible for the team?

 

A simple USD/mt timeseries/chart would be ok and CFR could be taken as Jeddah since you have the freight there, ideally 5 years history.

 

Thanks in advance
