Hello Nathan,

https://sucden.dnext.io/fundamentals/tradematrix/sucden-b17c9bc6-607c-4d01-88fa-a29399c56e7f

 

The download button is now available and fully functional.

 



 

Please note that TradeMatrix codes in the format "dnexr-xxxx-xxxx" (which were shared via our old system) will be removed soon.

 

We recommend using TradeMatrix codes in the "sucden-xxxx-xxxx" format, as these are trade flows shared via our new system. 

 

This ensures that any updates or changes to resources will be dynamically reflected in your access.
