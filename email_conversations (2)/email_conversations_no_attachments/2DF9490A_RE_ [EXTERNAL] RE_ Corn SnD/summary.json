    "solution": "The correct code for the corn SnD dataset is 'thul-c4ffcc58-c9b0-4935-a0c8-b93f28d7d674'. Users should verify they are using this code to download the latest corn SnD data. The FSI use values in the dataset for the latest publication date should correspond exactly with the FSI use values reported in the official report. If discrepancies occur, ensure the dataset code is correct and that the dataset is the latest publication version.",
