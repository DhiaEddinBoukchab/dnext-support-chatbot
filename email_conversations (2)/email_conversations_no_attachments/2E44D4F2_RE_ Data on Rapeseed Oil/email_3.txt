Subject: Data on Rapeseed Oil

 

Hi Team,

 

I was trying to look at data on Rapeseed and other veg oils but it is not updated on the portal. I can see the numbers for Seeds and meal but not for Oils. 

 

Can you pls check and let me know if we have that data available or not. 

 

Thanks and Regards
