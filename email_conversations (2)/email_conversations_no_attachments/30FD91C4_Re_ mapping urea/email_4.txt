Hi all,

 

So I’ve found some issues with the mapping of urea – see two codes below:

 

Mapping issue found : 

Correct:
Name : Urea
Code : FERTDU

 

Wrong:
Name : FERTDU
Code : Urea

 

However, the second issue is that with the correct mapping it shows FERTDU as product on the platform – but clients will not know this is urea unless we tell them. So it would be better to change it to Name: Urea and Code: UREA – but how easy is this and can we change everything over then so there are no issues?

 

Thank you!

 

All the best,
