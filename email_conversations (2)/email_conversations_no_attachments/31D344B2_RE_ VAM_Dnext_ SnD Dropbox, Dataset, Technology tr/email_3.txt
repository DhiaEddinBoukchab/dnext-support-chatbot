Hi Saber,

Thank you for the training today. It helped answer many of my questions!

I forgot to ask: could you send me some sample SQL queries for Data Prep when you get a chance?


Thank you again,
Oscar

Hello Oscar

 

Regarding the delivery of files, we are open to updating the files on another platform, such as SharePoint or any other alternative , as long as you grant us the necessary access. 

Please let us know if that would be an option for you.

 

As for the yearly data, we are currently working on processing the datasets to generate yearly values for each of the five Dnext SnD datasets. 

We will keep you informed and notify you once the processed datasets are ready and available on the platform.

 

Regarding the training session, Tuesday, June 10th 10 am Eastern time works perfectly for me. I will send out the invitation.

 

Please feel free to reach out if there is anything else I can assist with.

 

Best regards,

Hello Oscar,

 

Apologies for the delayed response.

 

We have provided you with access to a DropBox folder titled DNEXT_VAM, and both you and Neil should have received an invite to access it.

Thank you! I confirm that I can access the files.

I assume that to delivery those files, Dropbox is currently your only mechanism. If others exists, please kindly advice.

 

Regarding the second point, the data is updated monthly, so by default, there are no yearly values. However, if needed, the data can be processed to generate yearly values (you can refer to our SND dashboards for examples).

If you would like, we can create processed dataset where the data is transformed into yearly values for your convenience.

That will be great! Please go ahead and create such processed datasets for each of the five Dnexr SnD datasets (Corn, Oilseeds, Wheat, Veggie Oil, Wheat by Class). 

 

Additionally, we would be happy to set up a training session to walk you through the technical aspects of the platform.

Please let us know your availability, and we will arrange the session accordingly.

My schedule is very open from now through next Friday May 13. Anything that starts on/after 10am and concludes by 4pm US Eastern time will work for me.

 

For quicker assistance, kindly direct any requests to support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> , and we will ensure they are addressed promptly.

I will keep that in mind! The reason I haven't done so is that when I copied that address before, I often got the following message :

Subject: VAM/Dnext: SnD Dropbox, Dataset, Technology training

 

Hi Saber,

 

I hope this email finds you well. I have several technical questions about accessing Dnext's SnD. If it would make more sense to set up a training session, please let me know.

 

1. If I remember correctly, you also offer the ability to share Dnext's SnD file via Dropbox. If so, please kindly advise how we can set this up.

 

2. After exploring, I noticed that the Dnexr SnD Datasets contain exclusively monthly data, without aggregating to market year. Please kindly confirm whether that is the case, and if so, whether there is a machine-readable revenue through which yearly data could be accessed.

 

Thank you very much,
