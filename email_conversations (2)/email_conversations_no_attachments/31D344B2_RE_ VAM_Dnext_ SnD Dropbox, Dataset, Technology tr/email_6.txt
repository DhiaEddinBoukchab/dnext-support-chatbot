Hello Oscar,

 

Apologies for the delayed response.

 

We have provided you with access to a DropBox folder titled DNEXT_VAM, and both you and Neil should have received an invite to access it.

 

Regarding the second point, the data is updated monthly, so by default, there are no yearly values. However, if needed, the data can be processed to generate yearly values (you can refer to our SND dashboards for examples). 

If you would like, we can create processed dataset where the data is transformed into yearly values for your convenience.

 

Additionally, we would be happy to set up a training session to walk you through the technical aspects of the platform. 

 

Please let us know your availability, and we will arrange the session accordingly.

 

For quicker assistance, kindly direct any requests to support@dnext.io, and we will ensure they are addressed promptly.

 

Kind regards,

Subject: VAM/Dnext: SnD Dropbox, Dataset, Technology training

 

Hi Saber,

 

I hope this email finds you well. I have several technical questions about accessing Dnext's SnD. If it would make more sense to set up a training session, please let me know.

 

1. If I remember correctly, you also offer the ability to share Dnext's SnD file via Dropbox. If so, please kindly advise how we can set this up.

 

2. After exploring, I noticed that the Dnexr SnD Datasets contain exclusively monthly data, without aggregating to market year. Please kindly confirm whether that is the case, and if so, whether there is a machine-readable revenue through which yearly data could be accessed.

 

Thank you very much,
