    "problem": "The adjusted customs lineups data for Argentina incorrectly assigns all quantities to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, which does not reflect the actual data.",
    "solution": "The issue was identified in the SQL query used to combine customs and lineups data. The fix involves including the 'Country Partner' column in the join condition to correctly match records: specifically, adding the condition a.\"Country Partner\" = b.\"Country Partner\" in the SQL join. An updated SQL query example was provided for Corn product data, demonstrating how to correctly join and aggregate data from customs and lineups datasets by country partner and product hierarchy. This corrected query ensures that quantities are properly allocated to the correct countries rather than being incorrectly grouped into Saudi Arabia and Yemen.",
