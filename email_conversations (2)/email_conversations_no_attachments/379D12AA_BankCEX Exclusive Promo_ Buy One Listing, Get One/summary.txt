**Problem**: The customer is inquiring about the details and eligibility of the "Buy One Listing, Get One Free" promotion offered by BankCEX, specifically regarding the terms and conditions that apply.

**Context**: The customer is an external user interested in promotional offerings from a cryptocurrency exchange (BankCEX). The promotion is time-sensitive, ending on April 30, 2025, and involves listing packages that provide visibility for tokens across multiple platforms.

**Solution**: The support team provided detailed information about the promotion, clarifying that it applies to the same token for both exchanges and cannot be combined with other offers. The customer was encouraged to book their slot before the deadline and was advised to review the full terms available on the website.
