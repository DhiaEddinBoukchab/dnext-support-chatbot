Hi Saber,

Antoine is out of office most of this week, and on top of that it would be nice to get a couple of other colleagues (who will be heavy users of the platform) also to join the session, which doesn't happen within such a short timeframe.

Could you kindly propose slots for the beginning of next week, and we will align internally regarding schedules?

Kind regards,
Tuukka
