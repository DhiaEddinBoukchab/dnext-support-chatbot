**Problem**: The customer reported that the dashboard only displayed data up to November 19, despite pushing updates daily, including on November 21. They sought clarification on why the latest data was not reflected.

**Context**: The user is an external user, specifically the CEO of a Customer Organization. The issue involves a data dashboard feature of a service provided by the Service Provider. The customer is experiencing a delay in data updates after pushing new information.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed that the latest data was displaying correctly and indicated they would investigate the delay in data refresh, which occurs four hours after a data push. It is recommended that the customer monitor the dashboard after each push and report any further discrepancies.
