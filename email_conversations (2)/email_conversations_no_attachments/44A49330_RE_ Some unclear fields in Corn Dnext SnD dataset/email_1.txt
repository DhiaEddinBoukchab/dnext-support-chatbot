Hello Charlie 

Regarding the ‘use_floor’ the corn usage for flour is official statistics from Ukraine. 

The volumes are minimal, but it’s for food use. 

Similarly, what is labelled Protein use is what we call ‘use_groat’ in the SND. 

It is also minimum use.

 

Those 2 were data which were officially published by Ukraine before the war.

 

As for the not available rows it’s a technical issue from our side that should be fixed soon but they are also use_groat values

 

If you have any other questions or if you need further clarification please let us know

 

We thank you for your patience and understanding

 

Best regards

Subject: Some unclear fields in Corn Dnext SnD dataset

 

Hello Guillaume/Pablo, 

 

I am looking through the Corn SND dataset (thul-c4ffcc58-c9b0-4935-a0c8-b93f28d7d674) and notice some fields that do not make sense to me, so just hoping you can clarify.

 

I am not clear on what the following items with Item_MappedName ‘Protein Use’, ‘use_flour’ and ‘Not_Available’ (which are all values linked to Ukraine) are representing. Not_Available is a nan Item but does have values. ‘use_flour’ seems like it should be for wheat? ‘Protein_Use’, what does this represent, some aggregation? 

 

Thanks in advance for clarifying!

Charlie
