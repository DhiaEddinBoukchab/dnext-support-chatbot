    "problem": "Users are unclear about the meaning of certain fields in the Corn Supply and Demand (SnD) dataset, specifically the fields labeled 'Protein Use', 'use_flour', and 'Not_Available' linked to Ukraine data.",
    "solution": "The 'use_flour' field represents official statistics for corn usage in flour production in Ukraine, indicating minimal volumes used for food. The 'Protein Use' field corresponds to what is called 'use_groat' in the SnD dataset, also representing minimal usage. The 'Not_Available' rows are due to a technical issue on the data provider's side but also represent 'use_groat' values. These clarifications help interpret these fields correctly in the dataset.",
