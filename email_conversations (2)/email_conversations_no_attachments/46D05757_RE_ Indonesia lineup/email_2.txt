Subject: Indonesia lineup

================================================================================

There is still a problem with Indonesia lineup.

If I select only China, the graph don’t select only China. If I “Select all”, am I seeing China, Europe, India and US or am I seeing everything ? 

If I want to see the last 6 months ? why showing the months in the legend and not year+month ?

 

Thanks for fixing it
