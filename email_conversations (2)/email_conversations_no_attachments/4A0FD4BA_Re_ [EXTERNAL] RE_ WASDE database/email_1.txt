Hi Roberto,

 

I’m pleased to inform you that the issue with the WASDE database has been identified and resolved. 

 

The values for USA cotton exports, production, and the planted and harvested estimates should now be displaying correctly in the dashboard.

 

We sincerely apologize for the time it took to address this,thank you for your patience and understanding while we worked through the root cause.

 

If you notice anything further or have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Dear Roberto,

 

I’m following up regarding the dashboard issue. 

 

We are actively investigating the discrepancy in the values. 

 

While it’s proving to be a more complex issue than initially anticipated, we are working to identify the root cause, and this may take some time.

Hi Saber,

 

Hope this email finds you well.

 

I noticed that there’s an error in the wasde database, as the USA cotton values for recent years show no exports while the production values look inflated, as if they are being double counted.

There’s also no data for planted nor harvested estimates in recent years, so something is being incorrectly saved.

 

Could you pls look into this?

 

Many thanks
