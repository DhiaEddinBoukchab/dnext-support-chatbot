**Problem**: The customer requested stage access for a new user, needing assistance to set up the account.

**Context**: The request was made by a Data Scientist from Customer Organization for a user who is an intern. The inquiry involved granting access to the stage environment of a service provided by the organization.

**Solution**: The Support Agent created a user account for the intern in the stage environment and sent the login credentials privately. It is recommended to verify access and ensure that all new users receive their credentials promptly upon account creation.
