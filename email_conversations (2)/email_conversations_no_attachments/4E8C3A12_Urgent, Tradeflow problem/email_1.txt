Hello,

 

Experiencing some issues with the tradeflow, not sure if you guys are aware already ?

It seems double counting, for example : May 2020 ARG SBO, the dataset has 621kmt and tradeflow displays 1242.

I have this issue with the following Origin / Product combination in the dnexr-vegoils tradematrix :

ARG SBO from March 2018

ARG SFO no problem though

BRA SBO from as far as my tradeflow display i.e. Oct 2014

UKR RSO, SBO, SFO from Jan 2017 to April 2022

 

This one is quite urgent, thanks !
