HI Saber,

 

On Monday, Can you check why price in the dashboard for wheat, corn and potentially others are not reflecting latest prices. Take corn and wheat FOB. We pushed price on Friday morning for 1st May but Roberto and me for corn and whear was seeing only prices for 30th. I pushed today May 01st and May 02 and still I see 30th April. 

Roberto from MLP complained about it. 

 

Thank you
