    "solution": "The IMEA Crop Phenology data is no longer published directly by IMEA but is estimated by analysts using IMEA planting and harvest data combined with crop cycle information. This phenology data has been assimilated into the Brazil Crop Progress dashboard along with updates for the latest season. Users can now view the IMEA crop phenology by navigating to the platform section: Grains & Oilseeds (GnO Crop) > Brazil > Crop Progress Dashboard.",
