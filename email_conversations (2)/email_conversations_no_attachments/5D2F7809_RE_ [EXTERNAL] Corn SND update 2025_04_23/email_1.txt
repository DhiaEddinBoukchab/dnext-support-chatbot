Hello Roberto,

 

I hope you're doing well.

 

The values mismatch you're experiencing is due to the fact that you're consulting the Corn Tradematrix from our old system, which we are planning to phase out soon. As a result, the data there is no longer up to date.

 

If you navigate to your Tradematrix module and search for "Corn" in the "Name" column, you will notice there are two Corn Tradematrixes listed. 

 

We recommend using the one with the "Code" column formatted as "thul-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx," as this version is shared via our new system and is always up to date.

 



 



 

I hope this helps clarify things for you. Please let us know if everything looks good on your end or if there’s anything else we can assist with. Looking forward to hearing back from you!

 

Best regards,

Hi GG,

 

I noticed a mismatch between US corn exports in the SnD vs trade matrix:

 

I see Sep-Aug exports of 2593m bsl in the trade flows vs 2704m bsl in the SnD.

 

Could you pls let me know once the trade flows are updated?

 

 

Thanks and regards
