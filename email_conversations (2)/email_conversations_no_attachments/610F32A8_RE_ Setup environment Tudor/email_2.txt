Hello,

 

The DevOps team created a new client environment:

datahub.dnext.io

 

It will be used for different client. Our first need is for the client: Tudor: access to 1 dataset:

dnexr-dnexr-sug-bra-tf-lineups-vessel-daily-1

 

They will access it though the platform + APIs.

Contract start: 01.08.2025

Contract End: 31.07.2026

 

If you can setup this environment. I will send you later the users.

 

Many thanks

Sami
