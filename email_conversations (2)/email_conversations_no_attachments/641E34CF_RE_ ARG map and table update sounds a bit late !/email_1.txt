Hello Michel,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

Regarding wheat, the source (Bolsa de Cereales) has not published crop condition or crop stage data for the past two weeks. 

 

Only the harvest progress has been updated, and that is provided by region.

 

For Soybeans crop ratings it has been added.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

 

Best regards,

Hello Saber,

Wheat map:   not sure but the Arg data are produced every Thursday so we should have since last Friday the Nov 27 report. 
For Soybean, I am surprised also that we don’t have any crop rating.
