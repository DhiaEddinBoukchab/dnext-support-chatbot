Hi Saber,

Thanks!

Hi Saber,

 

How are you?

 

I am trying to access the comparison view on the trade matrix but could not view the previous trade matrix. Under snapshot 2 it says no data. Could you kindly assist.

 



 

I also have a few questions on the platform and thought an onboarding session might be the best forum to address them. Would you be able to propose some dates and times that works on your end? Thanks!

 

Rgds,
