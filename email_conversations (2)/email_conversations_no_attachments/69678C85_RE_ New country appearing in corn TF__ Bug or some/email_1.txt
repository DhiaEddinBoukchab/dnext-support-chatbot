Hello , 

 

I remember a client reporting this not long ago




 

I checked with @Guillaume Goudy <mailto:guillaume.goudy@dnext.io>  at the time and he asked me to revert it to how it was  

 

So, it’s likely that I was the one who placed Sudan in North Africa, since the client mentioned that was how it was initially.

What is happening in the corn TF?

I did not change anything and I have a new country showing up and in the wrong region. See below. Someone has put Sudan in North Africa. Did not add Sudan and definitely not North Africa.
