**Problem**: The customer reported that a new country, Sudan, appeared in the corn TF and was incorrectly categorized in North Africa, which they did not add or authorize.

**Context**: The user is an external user from a Customer Organization. The issue involves the corn TF feature of a service provided by a Service Provider. The customer is concerned about unauthorized changes made to the geographical categorization of countries.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed they would remove the incorrect entry and investigate who made the change. It was later revealed that a previous interaction with a client led to the erroneous placement of Sudan, and the Support Agent took responsibility for the mistake. The issue was resolved by reverting Sudan to its correct categorization. It is recommended to review changes made to the corn TF regularly to prevent similar issues.
