Hi Michel,

 

It seems is linked to an excel upgrade. Recently they added an option under the “Formulas” tab, Calculation section, “Calculation Options”.

This is where you set “Manual” or “Automatic” calculation of formulas.

Now they have “Format stale values”, which from what I understand is formatting with a strikethrough numbers not re-calculated.

If you uncheck the option, it will be gone.

 

Let me know if it solves it.

 

Thanks

Hello gents,

we face issues with the dropbox….  Look at this below. And sometimes, I get also an error message due to format.
Can you have a look at what is happening?  Is it some firewall restrictions from Ameropa?

thank you
