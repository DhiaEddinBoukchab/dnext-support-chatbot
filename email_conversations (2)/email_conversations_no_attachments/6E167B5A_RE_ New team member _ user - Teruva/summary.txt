**Problem**: The customer requested to add a new analyst to the platform and arrange a demo session for the team. They were concerned about the adequacy of the scheduled time for the demo.

**Context**: The user is an external user from a trading organization. The product involved is a platform for trading analytics. The demo session was initially scheduled for Thursday between noon and 3 PM Geneva time, but the customer expressed concerns about the time being too short.

**Solution**: A user account was created for the new analyst, and credentials were sent to them. The demo session was adjusted to start at 12 PM Geneva time to accommodate an additional analyst's participation. The support team confirmed their availability for the updated session.
