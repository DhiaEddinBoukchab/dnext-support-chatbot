Hello guys,

 

See below the map, 1 to 5, 6 to 10 and 11 to 15 are mostly blue, light red in the east of Ukraine. But the 1-15 map is dark red in some regions. How is that possible ?

Similarly the region in the extreme west of Ukraine, is white in 1-5, red in 6-10 and red again in 11-15. But the 1-15 map shows it blue.

 

Can you please take a look ? Thanks
