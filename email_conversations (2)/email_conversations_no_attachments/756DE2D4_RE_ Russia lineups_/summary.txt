**Problem**: The customer reported that the Russian lineups for corn showed a value of 0 for March, which seemed unusual, and requested verification of the original data source.

**Context**: The user is an external user from the Customer Organization seeking information related to agricultural data. The inquiry pertains to the data reporting feature of a service provided by the Service Provider.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed that the source indeed has no corn data for March. It was recommended to monitor the data source for updates, as the absence of data may be a temporary issue.
