Dear Joe,

 

Thank you for reaching out, and we are sorry to hear you’re experiencing this issue.

 

Could you kindly specify which dataset you encountered the error with? Additionally, could you let us know if the issue occurred while accessing the dataset through a web browser or while trying to fetch it via the API?

 

If the issue occurred in the browser, have you tried clearing your browser cache and attempting the action again?

 

If you encountered the error while using the API, may I suggest trying to re-authenticate and see if that resolves the issue?

 

We appreciate your patience and look forward to your response.

 

Best regards,
