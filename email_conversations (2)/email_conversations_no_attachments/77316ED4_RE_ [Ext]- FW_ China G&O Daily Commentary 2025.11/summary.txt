**Problem**: The customer requested the removal of a user from a distribution list due to delivery failures related to the user's email address.

**Context**: The customer is an external user from Customer Organization, and the issue involves email communication with a user at Service Provider. The email delivery failed with a 'Recipient not found' error, indicating that the email address may no longer be valid.
