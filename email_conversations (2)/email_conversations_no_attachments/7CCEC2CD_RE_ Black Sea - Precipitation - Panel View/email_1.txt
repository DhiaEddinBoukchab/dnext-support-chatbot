Hello Enea,

On our side, we have four data timestamps: 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z. In Power BI, we have implemented an automatic process to detect and display the latest available data in the dataset. If the most recent data is 06Z, then that is what will be shown.

The only change we could make is to remove 06Z and 12Z from the dataset if they are not needed. However, this should be discussed with the entire team to ensure it aligns with everyone's needs.

Thanks, 

Jebrane.

Hello Jebrane,

 

Thank you very much for the explanation!

 

However, when we select “Latest ECMWF”, should we not automatically shift to the latest 00Z or 12Z data?

Hi Enea,

This is not an issue. The ECMWF publishes complete data at 00Z and 12Z, as mentioned in their documentation:

https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-opendata



It’s normal to have missing values at 06Z and 18Z.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

Best,
Jebrane

PS

 

Pablo pointed out that by changing to “00” instead of “latest” ECMW, the display goes back to normal.

Hello,

 

I hope that this email find the support team well!

 

A client just noted that we have an error in the viewing of this weather dashboard: when we filter on Ukraine, to the top right the whole region appears. Would it be possible to fix this error, please? I also observe that no data is displayed on the top right.

 

Furthermore, might there be a way to zoom a bit more on Ukraine also on the other panels, please?
