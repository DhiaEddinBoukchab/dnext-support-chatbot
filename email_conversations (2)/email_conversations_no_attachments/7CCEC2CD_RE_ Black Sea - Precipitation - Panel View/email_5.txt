Hi Enea,
This is not an issue. The ECMWF publishes complete data at 00Z and 12Z, as mentioned in their documentation:

https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-opendata

It’s normal to have missing values at 06Z and 18Z.
Let me know if you need further clarification!
Best,
Jebrane

PS

 

Pablo pointed out that by changing to “00” instead of “latest” ECMW, the display goes back to normal.

Hello,

 

I hope that this email find the support team well!

 

A client just noted that we have an error in the viewing of this weather dashboard: when we filter on Ukraine, to the top right the whole region appears. Would it be possible to fix this error, please? I also observe that no data is displayed on the top right.

 

Furthermore, might there be a way to zoom a bit more on Ukraine also on the other panels, please?
