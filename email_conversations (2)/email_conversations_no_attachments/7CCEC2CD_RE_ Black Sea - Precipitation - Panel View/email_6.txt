Pablo pointed out that by changing to “00” instead of “latest” ECMW, the display goes back to normal.

Hello,

 

I hope that this email find the support team well!

 

A client just noted that we have an error in the viewing of this weather dashboard: when we filter on Ukraine, to the top right the whole region appears. Would it be possible to fix this error, please? I also observe that no data is displayed on the top right.

 

Furthermore, might there be a way to zoom a bit more on Ukraine also on the other panels, please?

 



 

Best,
