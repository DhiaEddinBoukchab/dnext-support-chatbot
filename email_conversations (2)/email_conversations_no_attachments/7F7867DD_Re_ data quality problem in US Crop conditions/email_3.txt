Objet : data quality problem in US Crop conditions 
 
Hi guys, in the US crop conditions dataset there are duplicates in 2024 (at least).

i know we are solving by calculating an average using the week. point is that publication date is different so a fast remove duplicates does not not work unless we know this.

think this needs to be solved, because if we share this with a client then there will be issues.
