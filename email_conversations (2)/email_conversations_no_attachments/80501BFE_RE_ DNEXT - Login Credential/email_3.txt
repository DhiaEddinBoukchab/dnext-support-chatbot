Morning Charles,

 

Hope you had a nice weekend – so for the trial the fertilizer dashboards have been placed in GnO Economics (see screenshot below) – you can also find fertilizers in the LineUps in dashboards (that’s where the WAF lineups are), also in Customs and the urea balance in SND. There is also a tradematrix for urea, DAP and ammonia.

 

Saber can book you in a tour to help – and then if there are any specific things that you need let me know as this is just a start and we can start building dashboards together.

 

All the best,
