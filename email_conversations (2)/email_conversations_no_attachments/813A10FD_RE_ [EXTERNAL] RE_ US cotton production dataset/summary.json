    "solution": "Set up a recurring task to scrape the daily updated table from the specified URL (https://www.ewrinc.com/cotton/contentPublic/reports/stateReceipts.aspx). Since the table is replaced daily and no history is available on the source site, the solution involves capturing the data each day and appending it to a dataset with a publication date field to track data history over time. The dataset is then made available on the platform with a unique access code, and it updates daily with new data and corresponding publication dates.",
