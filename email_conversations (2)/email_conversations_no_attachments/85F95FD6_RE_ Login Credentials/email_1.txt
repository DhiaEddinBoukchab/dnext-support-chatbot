Hello Shravan,

 

That’s the landing page.

 

You can consult the dashboards by clicking on the “Dashboards” Button on the left Menu(see image below for visual aid)

 



 

From there you should land in the following page where you can consult the Dashboards

 



 

You can also consult the Tradematrix Module by going through the “Fundamentals” Button on the left menu then “Tradematrix” as displayed in the image below : 




 

After that you should have a list of the available tradematrixes , you can view the one you want by clicking on the “eye” icon on the right side of each row : 

 

Note : you might notice that there are tradematrixes who are duplicates , that’s because we used to share them via an old system and now we are migrating to a new one , so we recommend using the tradematrixes which have Codes in this format “squarepoint-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx” as the other will be removed soon 



 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns 

 

Best regards,
