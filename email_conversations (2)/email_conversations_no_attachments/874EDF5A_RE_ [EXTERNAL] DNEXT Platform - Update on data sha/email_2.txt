Hi Saber,

 

Hope you had a good weekend.

 

I was running through some of the new trade flow codes and noticed that the “wheat aggregation” one isn’t giving us any values when pulling via API. 

 

Wheat aggregation

#code = 'thul-bca3ea16-feb8-43d0-8709-b29e1e45c627'

 

Could you please look into this? 

 

Many thanks

Dear All,

 

We are continuously working to improve your experience on our data platform.

This update aims to streamline access and ensure you always have the most relevant data available for you.

 

Key Points:

*	Automated Access: You will automatically receive access to the resources included in your subscription.
*	Dynamic Updates: Any changes or updates to your resources will be reflected in your access dynamically.

Impact on Current Users:

*	For clients using APIs, please note that the datasets and trade flow UIDs will be updated.
