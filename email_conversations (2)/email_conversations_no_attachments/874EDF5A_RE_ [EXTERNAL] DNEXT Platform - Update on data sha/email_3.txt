Dear All,

 

We are continuously working to improve your experience on our data platform. As part of our ongoing enhancements, we are automating the sharing of datasets, tradeflows, and dashboards based on your subscription. This update aims to streamline access and ensure you always have the most relevant data available for you.

 

Key Points:

*	Automated Access: You will automatically receive access to the resources included in your subscription.
*	Dynamic Updates: Any changes or updates to your resources will be reflected in your access dynamically.

Impact on Current Users:

*	For clients using APIs, please note that the datasets and trade flow UIDs will be updated.
