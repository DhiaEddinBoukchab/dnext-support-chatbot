    "problem": "Users experienced issues accessing aggregated trade flow data via API using new resource codes after a platform update changed dataset and trade flow UIDs.",
    "solution": "To correctly access aggregated TradeMatrix data via the DNEXT API after the update, use the provided Python script which: 1) Authenticates with the API using email, password, and environment name to obtain a token; 2) Submits a POST request to the aggregation download endpoint with the new trade flow code; 3) Polls the task status until the data is ready; 4) Downloads the CSV data from the returned URL; 5) Loads the data into a pandas DataFrame. Replace placeholders for email, password, and environment in the script accordingly. This method handles the changed URL structure for aggregated data downloads and ensures successful data retrieval.",
