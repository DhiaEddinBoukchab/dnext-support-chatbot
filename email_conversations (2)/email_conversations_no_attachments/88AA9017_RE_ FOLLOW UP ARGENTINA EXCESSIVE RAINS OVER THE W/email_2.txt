It seems the most people in the market after those 3 days are getting more rational behind losses due to the rains over the weekend. 

 

Losses over beans crop to be harvested market avg is 1.65mmT, minimum is 0.5mmT and maximum is 2.5mmT. I heard that one isolated person was pointing for a 5mmT this one I did not consider over the benchmark.

 

Over Corn market is quieter, assuming low losses over the fields.

 

Grey area still silo bags and storage.

Hello All,

 

Rains over Argentina started on Thursday (15th of May) and continues over the weekend, the unexpected event was the volumes in some regions reached 200mm (map below) and consequently will should impact both crops increasing lost area and quality issues.

 

Soybean crop still at 50.2mmT.  Harvested already reached 65% last week and the most affected region the harvest pace is more advanced with @75%/80%, due to this my first estimative for production losses is @1.62mmT, market will compare Vs 2016 when farmers had the same excess of rains during the harvest, the  major difference is in 2016 the excess of rains started earlier in April increasing the losses. If goes at 2016 pattern impact could be 2.2mmT. Those reduction will be made once we have more clarity at those situations.

 

Corn crop still at 51.9mmT. Harvested reached just 37% last week, however, the regions that were affected by the excess of rains are regions with majority of early corn and the harvested is already @80% adding to add the corn can hold more for the harvest in flood areas (comparing to 2016, corn had a normal year in terms of lost area), due to this my impact today is 1.39mmT.

 

If you want the rationale behind let me know.

 

GREY AREA are the silo bags and storage, this I don’t have until now a estimative, during the week we will dig more in those details, if any new information we let you know.  

 



 

 

Market should overestimate those losses, same pattern as happens in RGDS (Brazil) last year.

 

                                                        LAST 72h OF RAINS
