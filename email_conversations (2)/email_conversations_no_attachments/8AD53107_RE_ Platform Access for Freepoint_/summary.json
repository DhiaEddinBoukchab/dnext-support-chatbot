    "problem": "User cannot access the platform and receives a 'User not found' message, possibly due to using the wrong login URL or forgotten password.",
    "solution": "To resolve platform access issues: 1) Ensure the user logs in using the correct URL specific to their organization, for example, https://freepoint.dnext.io/. 2) If the user does not remember their password, instruct them to use the 'reset password' feature on the login page and follow the instructions to set a new password. This approach resolves common access problems related to incorrect URLs and forgotten passwords.",
