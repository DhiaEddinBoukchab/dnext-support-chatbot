Hi Saber,

 

Could you please help Aditya with the below  ?

The idea is to give them access to one of the demo account.

Ideally, would be good to give them access to only palm data or tease them with some other interesting stuff, but so they don’t get lost.

@Aditya Jeripotula <mailto:aditya.jeripotula@dnext.io> , could you please guide @Saber Khalfallah <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io>  on what dashboard / tradeflow we want to make accessible in the demo.

 

Thanks
