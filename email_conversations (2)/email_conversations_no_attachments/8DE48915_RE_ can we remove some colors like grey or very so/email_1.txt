Subject: can we remove some colors like grey or very soft tones from the dashboards?

 

with the recent changes we have some color selections which make the charts really difficult to visualize. can we remove some colors which dont seem to be a good choice? even highlighting the line is hard to see.

 

adding @Quentin Doublet <mailto:quentin.doublet@blackfryers.io>  as he has been working on this i believe. if not disregard.
