Hello,

 

We currently do not have county-level data available. However, we have added a column named "district" to the view you are querying, which contains district codes for each state.

 

For example, for Alabama, you might see entries like AL.10.

 

You can view district maps for each state using the link below. Just click on a state to see a map with its district numbers clearly labeled:

For instance, an entry like AL.10 refers to the highlighted district in the example image below:
(The image is accessible by clicking on Alabama in the link above.)

 



 

Let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance . 

We are happy to help!

 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi, 

 

Looking for county level weather data in the US, using this query:

account = 'gq42038.eu-west-1'
warehouse = 'ZIMB'
database = 'LAB'
schema = ''

 

 

cur.execute("SELECT * FROM \"ZIMB\".\"LAB\".\"usa-weather\" WHERE \"Region\" = 'Texas'")
