    "problem": "User queries the 'usa-weather' dataset expecting county-level weather data for US states but only receives state-level data.",
    "solution": "County-level weather data is not available in the 'usa-weather' dataset. Instead, a 'district' column has been added to the dataset view, which contains district codes representing subdivisions within each state (e.g., 'AL.10' for a district in Alabama). Users can reference district maps for each state at https://data.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Crops_County/boundary_maps/indexgif.php by clicking on a state to see district numbers and boundaries. To get more granular data, query the 'district' column in the dataset rather than expecting county-level data.",
