Hello Neil,

 

Thank you for reaching out.

 

Regarding your question, the dashboard shown in the second image is still under internal review and has not been published yet. As such, the most current DNEXT balance may not be reflecting in it yet. 

 

This could be a bug, as the it is not supposed to be visible before it's published.

 

Could you kindly let us know where you found the second dashboard? Since it’s not published yet, it’s not intended to be visible, and understanding where it appeared would help us identify the bug faster and fix it.

 

Best regards,
