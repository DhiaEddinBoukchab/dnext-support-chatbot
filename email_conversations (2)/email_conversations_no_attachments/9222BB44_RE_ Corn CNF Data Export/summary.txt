**Problem**: The customer was having difficulty analyzing data from the dashboard, specifically needing the August vs. November santos value expressed as a spread.

**Context**: The customer is an external user from a Customer Organization seeking assistance with a data export feature in a dashboard provided by a Service Provider. The issue arose after the customer received guidance on exporting data to Excel but found the presentation of the data inadequate for analysis.

**Solution**: The Support Agent proposed a Teams call to gather more details about the customer's needs. Following the discussion, a "Spread" tab was added to the existing Corn CNF dashboard to facilitate the customer's request. The customer was informed of this update and invited to provide feedback.
