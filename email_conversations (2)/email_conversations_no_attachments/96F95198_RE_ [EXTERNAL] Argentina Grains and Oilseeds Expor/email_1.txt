Hi Rafael, 

 

No, not yet, unfortunately.

I will try to have them included with next week's reports (Including the regression for sailed).

Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you in advance for your patience.

 

Best,

Hi,

 

Any progress on this?

 

Could you also do a regression (and plot) for sailed by x date vs y total sailed? Similar to the nominations one but for sailed?

 

Thanks,

Rafael

Hi,

 

 



 

Could you also add a line graph of this data to see the evolution of the regression forecast, sailed, and the DNEXR Forecast? I want to easily be able to see day on day/week on week/month on month change.

 

Thanks,
