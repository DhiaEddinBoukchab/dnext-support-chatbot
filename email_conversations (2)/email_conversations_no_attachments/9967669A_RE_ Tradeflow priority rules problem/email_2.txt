Subject: Tradeflow priority rules problem
Message-ID: ZR0P278MB077392F0CED21879440B9E6298D1A@ZR0P278MB0773.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM

================================================================================

So I have the following configuration. The problem is : the “DNEXR – Vegoils” I don’t want to make it official after May. While “Tradeflow – Customs – Ukraine, Ukraine Customs, All monthly” is updated up to October.

Then in the matrix, it just fills SFO with 0s instead of my forecast.
