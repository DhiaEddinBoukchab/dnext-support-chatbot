**Problem**: The customer reported that the font size in the new plot style is too small and the color palette does not effectively distinguish between different years, making it hard to read the data.

**Context**: The user is an external user (Grains Analyst) from a Customer Organization. The issue involves a data visualization feature of a service provided by a Service Provider. The customer is seeking improvements in plot readability and color differentiation.

**Solution**: The Support Agent acknowledged the feedback and escalated the issue to the team for improvements regarding plot style, readability, and color palette. The customer will be informed once the updates are completed, and no immediate action was required from the customer.
