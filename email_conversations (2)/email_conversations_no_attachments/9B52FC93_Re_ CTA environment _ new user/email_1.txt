Hello,

 

It seems upon adding George to the distribution list, an error we did not catch prevented it from going through. 

 

This has now been fixed, and he should start receiving our reports.

 

@George Zanovello <mailto:G.zanovello@cta.group> , please don’t hesitate to reach out if you do not receive the upcoming reports , I will be happy to assist.

 

Best regards,
