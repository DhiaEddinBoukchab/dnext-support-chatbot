Hello Sami, 

Should we add the weather dashboards from them? 
Currently, we only have 6 dashboards available under Urea & Fertilizers 
Taxud , Economics Weekly prices and India Urea Tenders. 
@Elfi Middelbeek <mailto:elfi.middelbeek@dnext.io>  from your point of view, do you think they will need the weather dashboards as well? 

Thanks, 
Jebrane.
