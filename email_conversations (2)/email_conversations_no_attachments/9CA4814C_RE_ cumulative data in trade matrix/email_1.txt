Hello Michel,

 

Happy New Year! I hope you're doing well.

 

Thank you for reaching out. Yes, it is indeed possible to display cumulative numbers directly on the screen within the trade matrix view, as well as in a graph.

 

You can find this and more quick graphs in the “analysis” tab 




 

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need help with anything.

 

Best regards,

Hello Support and Happy New Year,

In a trade matrix view, can I get cumulative number over the year on the screen? And in a graph ?  I believe an option was available earlier.  

   

 

Of course I can download but I want to save time.

thank you, 

best regards,
