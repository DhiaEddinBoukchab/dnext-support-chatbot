Hello Saber,

Thank you for fixing case 2. For curiosity, what was the source of the issue?

 

For case one this is so bizarre, I still see data for the 21st when I asked another colleague in the office and he sees it too. Could you please investigate why you do not see it on your side and why the platform cannot extract it?

Hello,

 

I noted several dataset update issues today (2 datasets).

 

Both scrap data from an Excel document, may you please investigate?

 

For today I did by hand to send to clients but it is a problem that we have inserted no price data when in fact it is there.

 

Case 1:

Ran it twice and did not update 21st data
