Hello,

 

I noted several dataset update issues today (2 datasets).

 

Both scrap data from an Excel document, may you please investigate?

 

For today I did by hand to send to clients but it is a problem that we have inserted no price data when in fact it is there.

 

Case 1:

Ran it twice and did not update 21st data
