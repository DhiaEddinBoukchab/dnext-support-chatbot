we apologize for the inconvenience caused. The issue you experienced with the disappearance of the dashboards and the "Sugar" button was due to a small technical bug, which has now been fixed earlier this morning.






You should be able to navigate to all the categories in the dashboards again without any issues. If you encounter any further problems or have any questions, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Good morning Guillaume,

 

Sorry to bother you with IT problems – probably not your department. Tried to e-mail your (ex?)colleague Mohamed, but the e-mail bounced.

 

Could you please help me get to the right person with troubles on the Dnext platform? See my e-mail below. 

 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Good morning Mohamed,

 

On the Dnext platform I’ve accessed data on trade flow and price information for a long time. 

However, the dashboards seem to all have disappeared. Now only the button “sugar” is available, but even clicking on that gives no data anymore.

 

Tried both the react app and via the website, both with the same result.

 

Could you please help me with this issue?
