Hello Saber,

 

No if we have monthly data we show it as monthly, in a new dataset, meanwhile if we have weekly data, we show it as weekly. We do not need to estimate monthly from weekly though.

Hello , 

 

Is there a file for monthly data or we just sum the values that are in the same month ?

also noticed in the source that some of the data is monthly and we are mapping the value period as “WEEK” for all the data

 



 



 

Also for the column adding we need to pass by the dev team for that the easiest way is to create a new dataset

Best regards,

Dear Customer Support Team,

 

Verbio client is asking whether it is possible either to:

*	Add a column with the monthly data
*	Or, create a new dataset with monthly data

Whichever is easiest for you.
