**Problem**: The customer reported receiving unusually high crop rating values and requested verification of the data.

**Context**: The user is an external analyst from a Customer Organization, seeking assistance from a Support Team at a Service Provider. The issue arose after updates were made to crop condition values for winter wheat, which may have led to data discrepancies.

**Solution**: The Support Team investigated the issue and identified that the high values were due to duplicated data points in the updates.
