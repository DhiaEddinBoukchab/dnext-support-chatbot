**Problem**: The customer requested the setup of a new environment (enesel.dnext.io) for specific commodities and a defined period, along with the addition of several new users.

**Context**: The user is an external user from a Customer Organization requesting a setup for a service provided by a Service Provider. The environment is intended for commodities trading, specifically for G&O and Sugar, covering a long-term period.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed the setup of the environment and added the specified users to the system. It is recommended that the Customer Organization regularly review user access and ensure that all required permissions are correctly assigned for optimal operation.
