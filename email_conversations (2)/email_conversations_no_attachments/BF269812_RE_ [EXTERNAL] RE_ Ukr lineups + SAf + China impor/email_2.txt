Hello,

 

We noticed that we lost the China’s tab within the Economics dashboards (where we could consult the corn import margin updates). Could you please let us know once this is restored?

 

 



 

 

Many thanks

China import margin daily is nearly ready. Import margin table is ok but still need to fix bugs on the tab called import margin graph. It should update in the platform. Please let me know if you have access to it. 

Regarding SAF, i had a meeting this morning with SAF contacts and it will take more time. Basically, the bottleneck is getting access to freight prices in SAF. SAGIS publish export/import parity but they are wrong because they use rail rates. Issue is that there is no rail available in the country. One needs to have truck rates. So once i secure these rates, we will be able to calculate import/export parities. 

Regarding Ukr lineups. See below. We just received an update but no much progress compared to last update which is very strange. I checked the numbers from the source and it is correct. 

Talk this pm.
