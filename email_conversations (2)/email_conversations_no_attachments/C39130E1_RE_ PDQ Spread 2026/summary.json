    "problem": "The drop-down list for selecting years in a dashboard does not include the year 2026, showing data only up to December 2025.",
    "solution": "The year selection is based on the 'delivery_period_start' field. Although the source data provides information beyond December 2025, the data extraction script was statically configured to a fixed period ending in 2025. To resolve this, adjust the script to dynamically include the latest available data periods and refresh the dashboard. This will update the drop-down list to include 2026 and future years as data becomes available.",
