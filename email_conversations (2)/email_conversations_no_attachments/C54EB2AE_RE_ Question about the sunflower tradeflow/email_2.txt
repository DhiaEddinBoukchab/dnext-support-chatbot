Hi, 

 

I am wondering if you will still update the sunflower / sunflower seeds TF? It seems to me that the 2024/25 doesn’t have data anymore, yet for other seeds it does. Is there a reason that’s discontinued? 

 

My second question is what are the legends “dark grey” and “purple”? They are not referred in the “legends” tab 

 

Thank you!
