**Problem**: The customer inquired whether updates for the sunflower/sunflower seeds trade flow data would continue, noting that the 2024/25 data appeared to be missing. Additionally, they requested clarification on the meaning of the "dark grey" and "purple" legends, which were not defined in the legends tab.

**Context**: The customer is an external user from a Customer Organization seeking information from a Service Provider regarding a specific product feature related to trade flow data. The inquiry highlights a potential data discontinuation and a lack of clarity in the product documentation.
