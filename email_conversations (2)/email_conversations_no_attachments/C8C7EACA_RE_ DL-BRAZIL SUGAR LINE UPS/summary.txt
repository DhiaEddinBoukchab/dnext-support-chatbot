**Problem**: The customer inquired whether the DL (Distribution List) was amended to remove DL-Balysny that morning.

**Context**: The user is an external user from Customer Organization seeking clarification on a distribution list change related to the Service Provider's system. The inquiry arose shortly after the potential amendment was made.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed that the DL-Balysny was indeed removed, likely by another team member. It is recommended to monitor changes to distribution lists regularly and communicate any amendments to all relevant users to avoid confusion.
