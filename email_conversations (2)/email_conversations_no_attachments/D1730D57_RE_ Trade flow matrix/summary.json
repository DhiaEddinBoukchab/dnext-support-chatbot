    "problem": "Users experience confusion due to duplicate TradeMatrix files appearing with different code formats.",
    "solution": "To identify the correct and up-to-date TradeMatrix files, use those with the new code format 'ameropa-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx'. These files are part of a new sharing system that dynamically updates access and content, ensuring the latest versions are always available. Avoid using the old format 'dnexr-xxxx-xxxx' files, as they are being phased out and will be removed soon. Transitioning to the new format prevents confusion and guarantees access to the most current TradeMatrix data.",
