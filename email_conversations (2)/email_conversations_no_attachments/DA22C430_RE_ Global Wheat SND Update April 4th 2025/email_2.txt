Hi All,

 

I hope you are doing well.

 

I found a few differences between the report below and the “WORLD_WHT_SND_PACKAGE.xlsm” file saved in the shared folder. 

 

For instance, Australian production for the 24/25 crop on the report is 33,457 but the file has Aussie production at 34,110.  

 



 



 

Similar differences in other countries too.

 

Cheers,
