    "problem": "Lineup data for Canadian shipments shows no destination information, causing confusion about whether the data represents inspection lineups or actual shipment lineups.",
    "solution": "The missing destination data occurs because the corn shipment data comes from CGC inspections, which do not include destination information, while the D-lineup data covers only West coast ports with vessel tracking. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to clearly indicate in the Canadian lineups that the data is a mix of West coast-only vessel lineups and CGC inspection data without destinations. This clarification helps users understand why some lineups lack destination details and prevents future questions.",
