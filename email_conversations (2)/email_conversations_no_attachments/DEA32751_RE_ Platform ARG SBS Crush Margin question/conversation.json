Brazil is from Brazil, China CNF is not FOB+Freight, we get directly the offers and bids in the CNF market which is trading on its own.\r\n\r\nThere can be some variations, see below the spread CNF Oct-25 vs FOB Oct-25.\r\n\r\nWe have a range 105 – 125. It turns out the 7th August you picked was on the lows, because it seems the CNF quote had not picked the increase yet while the FOB did. The next day the gap got corrected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this helps answer your questions. Please let me know if you have any more questions or if you need anything else.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSaber Khalfallah\r\n\r\nCustomer Support\r\n\r\n                                                                                                     saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDNEXT INTELLIGENCE SA | Avenue Louis-Casaï 81 | CH-1216 Cointrin\r\n\r\ninfo@dnext.io <mailto:info@dnext.io>  | www.dnext.io <https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dnext.io%2f&c=E,1,x7kiS8-6RL9Byhe46BMEaHiAqwyuf-BIIeuO025ykh10dTpIypGsjpngITFhWTG1_P9piA5ibMNkzclbeN2IOQQTV4FP3j58iOCFSWkUxCrw&typo=1> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Oscar Shi <oshi@valentassetmgmt.com <mailto:oshi@valentassetmgmt.com> > \r\nSent: Friday, August 8, 2025 19:16\r\nTo: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> >\r\nCc: Neil Smaldon <nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com <mailto:nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com> >; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> >\r\nSubject: Re: FOB Soybean Price questions\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi Saber,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to my earlier questions below, I'd like to add this one to your plate:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand why, week-on-week, China Crush Margin is up $7 but Europe Crush Margin is down $2, according to the Platform.\r\n\r\nLooking at the breakdown, I noticed that the WoW movement in Brazil Soybean basis differed significantly between those two destinations.\r\n\r\nI always thought that CFR basis moves in lockstep with FOB, so does that mean the ocean freight changed significantly WoW?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again,\r\n\r\nOscar\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> >\r\nSent: Thursday, July 24, 2025 12:59 PM\r\nTo: Oscar Shi <oshi@valentassetmgmt.com <mailto:oshi@valentassetmgmt.com> >\r\nCc: Neil Smaldon <nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com <mailto:nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com> >; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io <mailto:support@dnext.io> >\r\nSubject: RE: FOB Soybean Price questions \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHello Oscar,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s updated until the 23rd of July now,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs for your second & third point I will check it and get back to you asap\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSaber Khalfallah\r\n\r\nCustomer Support\r\n\r\n                                                                                                     saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDNEXT INTELLIGENCE SA | Avenue Louis-Casaï 81 | CH-1216 Cointrin\r\n\r\ninfo@dnext.io <mailto:info@dnext.io>  | www.dnext.io <https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dnext.io%2f&c=E,1,JC9CrNDKowi_8XFqjzWHRWODsJdmMpMbSHLY1DkzmC5k4yIW06C0MNnqr2j0b-gRTECO-qHJ7JltGu13VC7Qxd8dAJ1chhFgXFqcPtbP7ziqJBPyh0sfcF_1KqVw&typo=1> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Oscar Shi <oshi@valentassetmgmt.com <mailto:oshi@valentassetmgmt.com> >\r\nSent: Wednesday, July 23, 2025 21:56\r\nTo: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io <mailto:saber.khalfallah@dnext.io> >\r\nCc: Neil Smaldon <nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com <mailto:nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com> >\r\nSubject: FOB Soybean Price questions\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi Saber,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have a few questions regarding the FOB Soybean Price table below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(1) (orange) When do you think we can get another update?

      "body_text": "Hi Saber and Support team,\r\n\r\nARG SBS Crush Margin has become an important metric to watch after yesterday's news.\r\n\r\nLooking at the values on the Platform now, I'm surprised that ARG SBS cash price was up a whopping $60/mt yesterday (whereas both CME and FOB ARG basis were down significantly).\r\n\r\nCould you help check whether that is correct?\r\n\r\nhttps://vam.dnext.io/dashboard/*/GnO%20Economics/Industrial%20Margins/2a46a8d9-349c-4592-9a0e-932a36002b30\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Saber Khalfallah <saber.khalfallah@dnext.io>\r\nSent: Thursday, August 14, 2025 1:24 PM\r\nTo: Oscar Shi <oshi@valentassetmgmt.com>\r\nCc: Neil Smaldon <nsmaldon@valentassetmgmt.com>; Support Dnext <support@dnext.io>\r\nSubject: RE: FOB Soybean Price questions \r\n \r\n\r\nHello Oscar,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApologies for the delayed response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 : not having a very good definition yet in JFM, I have no FOB indication, seeing JFM 75F, 80H 81H for J, F and M respectively, but not getting indication from many sources so it is not well defined\r\n\r\nQuestion 3 is a typo, should be the X.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegarding the CNF and FOB, we get the quotes from different sources for China. Brazil is from Brazil, China CNF is not FOB+Freight, we get directly the offers and bids in the CNF market which is trading on its own.\r\n\r\nThere can be some variations, see below the spread CNF Oct-25 vs FOB Oct-25.\r\n\r\nWe have a range 105 – 125. It turns out the 7th August you picked was on the lows, because it seems the CNF quote had not picked the increase yet while the FOB did. The next day the gap got corrected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope this helps answer your questions.
