Subject: Platform ARG SBS Crush Margin question

 

Hi Saber and Support team,

 

ARG SBS Crush Margin has become an important metric to watch after yesterday's news.

 

Looking at the values on the Platform now, I'm surprised that ARG SBS cash price was up a whopping $60/mt yesterday (whereas both CME and FOB ARG basis were down significantly).

 

Could you help check whether that is correct?

Subject: RE: FOB Soybean Price questions 

 

Hello Oscar,

 

Apologies for the delayed response.

Question 2 : not having a very good definition yet in JFM, I have no FOB indication, seeing JFM 75F, 80H 81H for J, F and M respectively, but not getting indication from many sources so it is not well defined

Question 3 is a typo, should be the X.

 

Regarding the CNF and FOB, we get the quotes from different sources for China. Brazil is from Brazil, China CNF is not FOB+Freight, we get directly the offers and bids in the CNF market which is trading on its own.

There can be some variations, see below the spread CNF Oct-25 vs FOB Oct-25.

We have a range 105 – 125. It turns out the 7th August you picked was on the lows, because it seems the CNF quote had not picked the increase yet while the FOB did. The next day the gap got corrected.

 

 



 

I hope this helps answer your questions. Please let me know if you have any more questions or if you need anything else.

 

Best regards,

Subject: Re: FOB Soybean Price questions

 

Hi Saber,

 

In addition to my earlier questions below, I'd like to add this one to your plate:

 

I'm trying to understand why, week-on-week, China Crush Margin is up $7 but Europe Crush Margin is down $2, according to the Platform.

Looking at the breakdown, I noticed that the WoW movement in Brazil Soybean basis differed significantly between those two destinations.

I always thought that CFR basis moves in lockstep with FOB, so does that mean the ocean freight changed significantly WoW?

 



Thank you again,

Oscar

Hi Saber,

 

I have a few questions regarding the FOB Soybean Price table below:

 

(1) (orange) When do you think we can get another update? (The last one was last Friday's)

(2) (pink) We look forward to seeing some definition of US JFM values. (I think CIF tends to be pretty well defined well into the future?)

(3) (red) Which futures contract is the Oct-25 FOB Paranagua Paper priced against? (I don't think it should be V)

Hi Support team,

 

I was looking for CIF NOLA Corn basis, only to find out that for July, the last update was June 18 (a week ago from today, June 25).

 

So I want to check whether that is a typical lag or something happened either with your source or within your process.
