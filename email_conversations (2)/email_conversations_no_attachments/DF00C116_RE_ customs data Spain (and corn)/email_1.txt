Actually, corn seems messed up too. 

 

When I download the excel from the tradematrix section of the database, it matches what was in the presentation (24/25 at 179,541). But when I look at the viewer it shows 179,512. See screenshots below.

Hi Saber,

 

Hi Saber,

 

I’m not sure if it’s connected, but the Soybean and Soymeal Tradeflow file does not give me forward projections. I have attached what it gives me on the excel (Jan-25 is the latest month and it only shows the parts that are finalized). It also doesn’t show it on the visualize, see screenshot:

 



 

 

Corn works. 

 

Thanks

Hi Saber,

 

The recent data shows up, but now there is another problem. When I download the excel from the tradematrix section, it does not have all partners. I selected intra flow and rest of world like I always did before. And even for the ones that are in both sets the numbers aren’t exactly the same. 

 

I am showing an example of soymeal exports, but the problem is for both imports and exports and other commodities. 

 

I have attached the two excel files. The one that has (21) on it was downloaded Jan 16, 2025 while the (22) one was today. 

 

If you have correct excel files but the website is going to take longer to fix, can you go ahead and send me the excels right away please while you work on the site?

 



 

Thank you

Hello Jennie 

Thank you for reaching out ! 

 

It seems that the automatic data refresh scheduling is not working as expected. 

 

As a result, the data was not up to date and required a manual refresh. 

 

Now, the data is displayed correctly in the tradematrix.

 

We are currently working on fixing the issue with the automatic refresh scheduling, and it should be resolved soon.

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Hello,

 

The tradematrix is only showing data through Nov-24 (see 2nd screenshot below). The details says that Dec-24 is available. Do you know why it is not showing up?
