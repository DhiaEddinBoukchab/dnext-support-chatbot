**Problem**: The customer requested the ability to download sugar trade flow data that includes both realized and forecasted information. Currently, the system only uploads official data without any forecasts.

**Context**: The user is an external user from a Customer Organization communicating with a Service Provider's support team. The issue involves the trade flow functionality of a data platform related to sugar trade, and there are challenges with data integration, particularly concerning forecast uploads.

**Solution**: The Support Agent was tasked with coordinating with the sugar team to explore the possibility of modifying the data upload process to include forecasts. Team members discussed involving another colleague to assist with data transfer challenges, indicating a collaborative approach to resolving the issue. Further updates were expected as the situation progressed.
