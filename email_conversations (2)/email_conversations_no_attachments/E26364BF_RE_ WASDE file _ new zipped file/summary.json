    "problem": "Users receive a zipped WASDE file containing 4 separate CSV files instead of a single CSV file and are unsure how to handle this new format.",
    "solution": "The zipped WASDE file now contains four CSV files, each representing a quarter of the dataset. This chunking is designed to make managing larger files easier. Users should merge these four CSV files to reconstruct the full dataset. For smaller datasets, a single file download option may be available in the future.",
