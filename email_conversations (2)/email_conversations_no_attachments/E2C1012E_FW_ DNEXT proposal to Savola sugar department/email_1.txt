	Thank you for your email.

	 

	Unfortunately, the proposed pricing significantly exceeds our expectations and is approximately double the rates we currently pay to other providers for comparable services. As a result, it would be challenging for us to proceed with the current proposal.  

	 

	That said, we remain interested in exploring whether there may be alternative options/ package/ pricing you could offer?
