Hello Rafael

we are sorry for the delayed response  

you are missing the “reference” column here which you can use to interpret these values


 

As you can see above the two FOB quotes for march represent two different Futures Contracts References :

*	H2025 (March 2025 contract)
*	K2025 (May 2025 contract)


I also want to inform you that the Soybean CNF , FOB and Freight dataset is now available you can fetch it with the API using this code : 

“zimb-b327c07f-efd6-11ef-bba5-0a84c630a3f1”

if you have any more questions or if you need further clarification please don’t hesitate to reach out 

 

We thank you for your patience and understanding

 

Best regards,
