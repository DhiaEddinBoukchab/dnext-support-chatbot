Non-event soybean report as expected. Only meaningful change is a small increase on crush +10, backed by the higher domestic meal use +300k shtn which was necessary.

The old crop Brazil is revised higher +1.5mmt to 154.5, likely following the finalization of Abiove crush higher (+800kt vs their 55mmt) and their SND  becoming too tight. New crop remains still at 169.

Chinese demand, Argentina crop unchanged also.

Soybean oil SND also makes sense their change, +500 mln lbs to 2.3 which is close to what we have. They reduced domestic demand to compensate.
