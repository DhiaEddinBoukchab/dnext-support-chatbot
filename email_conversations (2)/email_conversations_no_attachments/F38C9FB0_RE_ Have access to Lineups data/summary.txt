**Problem**: The customer requested access to Lineups data on the platform, specifically for the US, Ukraine, Argentina, and Brazil, as they only had access to Canada and Indonesia Lineups.

**Context**: The user is an external user from a Customer Organization seeking data from a Service Provider's platform. The request was made after initial access was granted, indicating a need for broader data availability.

**Solution**: The Support Agent confirmed that access to the requested Lineups data was granted and should now be available on the platform. The customer was encouraged to reach out for further assistance if needed.
