Hi Saber,

 

Hope the week is going well.

 

Quick query: the weekly data reported in the dashboard of Canadian producer deliveries (SND section) seems to be missing the last couple of weeks. Could you please confirm once this is updated?

Also, is there any dataset code associated to this set so I can run an API query on it?

 

Thanks
