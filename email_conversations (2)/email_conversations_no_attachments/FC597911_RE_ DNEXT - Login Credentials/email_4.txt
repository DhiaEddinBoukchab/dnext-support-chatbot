Hi Priyanka,

 

Thanks for your note! I completely understand , the platform can feel a bit overwhelming at first. To help make things easier, I’d be happy to set up a quick demo session where I can walk you through the key features and show you some tips for using it more effectively.

 

Please feel free to coordinate with your colleague and let me know a time that works best for both of you. 

I’ll adjust accordingly.

Looking forward to helping you get the most out of the platform!
