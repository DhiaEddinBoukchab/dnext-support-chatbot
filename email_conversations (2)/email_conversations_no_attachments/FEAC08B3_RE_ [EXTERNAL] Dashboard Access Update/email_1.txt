Hi Stella,

 

Thanks for your question!

 

The files inside the zip folder are split chunks of the same dataset, with each containing a part of the data. This was done to make it easier to manage larger files. To get the full dataset, you'll need to merge all the CSV files together.

 

Our team is working on improving this so that users can download the full dataset in one file for smaller datasets.

 

Let me know if you have any other questions!

 

Best regards,

Hi,

 

Hope all is well. I was wondering if anything has changed on the DNEXR datasets download – before it seems that when I clicked Download, I could download the latest updated file, vs. this time it shows a whole zipped folder. 

DNEXT - Datasets <https://cresource.dnext.io/datasets/cresource-4c8d416c-7f52-4f39-8643-a386e4c3a443/general> 

 



 

Specifically for DNexr oilseeds, I don’t think any of the file includes the latest updated version (Jan 2026?) or perhaps I am missing something here. 

 

Could you please kindly help me with that? 

 

Thanks,

Stella

Hi,

 

Hope all is well. Just hope check with you on one of the DNext dashboards – the India SEA stats. It does not seem like I have access to it. The link shared with me was dnexr.dnext.io/dashboard/*/SND/India/6a4da16b-3dc8-4a91-bd7b-d28de632c5a8 <https://dnexr.dnext.io/dashboard/*/SND/India/6a4da16b-3dc8-4a91-bd7b-d28de632c5a8>  – could you please kindly help me take a look? 

 

Thanks,
