      "solution": "Increase the wait time in the polling loop that checks the task status after initiating a dataset download. Instead of relying on a fixed number of retries with fixed sleep intervals, implement a backoff strategy where the wait time starts at 2 seconds and increments by 1 second after each unsuccessful status check, up to a maximum of 30 seconds. This approach controls the real elapsed time more accurately and prevents premature timeout errors. The provided Python script demonstrates how to implement this logic by polling the task status endpoint until the task status is 'SUCCEEDED' or the wait time exceeds 30 seconds. Adjust the wait_time parameter upwards if larger datasets cause timeouts.",

      "solution": "To change the product mapping for urea to have the name 'Urea' and code 'UREA', follow these steps: 1) Edit the product reference with the code 'UREA' and change the name from 'FERTDU' to 'Urea'. 2) Use the Reference Management > Correction feature to replace all instances of the reference with name 'Urea' and code 'FERTDU' with the new reference (name 'Urea', code 'UREA'). Alternatively, if the previous mapping was incorrect and not from static values, use the 'Reapply Mapping' feature to correct the mapping without needing Reference Manager permissions. This method is simpler and less risky. These steps ensure the product is correctly identified as urea on the platform without confusing clients.",

Regarding dataset downloads, large datasets are now split into multiple CSV files within a zipped folder to facilitate management of large files. To use the dataset, users must download the zipped folder and merge all CSV files together to reconstruct the full dataset.
