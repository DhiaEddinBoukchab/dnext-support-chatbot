        "model_response": "**Market‑analysis workflow in the Dnext platform**\n\nBelow is a concise, step‑by‑step guide you can follow to build a robust market‑analysis view for any agricultural commodity (e.g., wheat, corn, soy). The same process applies to other products supported by the Trade Matrix module.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n1. **Active Dnext account** with permission to use the **Trade Matrix** module.  \n2. At least one **data source** (e.g., customs export data, global trade statistics) already loaded in the platform.  \n3. Basic familiarity with pivot‑table concepts (optional but helpful).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Create a New Trade Matrix\n\n| Action | What to do |\n|--------|------------|\n| **2.1** | Open the **Trade Matrix** module and click **“Create New Matrix”**. |\n| **2.2** | Give the matrix a descriptive name, e.g., **“2024‑25 Wheat Market Outlook”**. |\n| **2.3** | Choose the **Export** or **Import** mode depending on the perspective you need. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Select Content & Sources  \n\n1. **Datasets** – Tick the datasets that will feed the matrix (e.g., **Global Wheat Trade Statistics**, **Customs Export Data**).  \n2. **Reporters (Origins)** –  \n   * Locate the countries you want to analyse as exporters (or importers).  \n   * Move them to the right panel.  \n   * **Best practice:** group them into regional folders (e.g., *Americas*, *Europe*, *Asia*) for quick filtering later.  \n3. **Partners (Destinations)** –  \n   * Select the target markets (e.g., China, Egypt, Japan).  \n   * Organise them in regional folders as above.  \n4. **Products** – Choose the commodity (e.g., **Wheat**) and, if needed, specific varieties (Hard Red Winter, Soft White).  \n\n> **Tip:** Keep the selection focused on the market segment you are analysing; extra reporters/partners only increase processing time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Configure Settings  \n\n| Setting | Why it matters | How to configure |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Unreported** | Flags countries whose data are estimated/forecasted rather than official. | In the **Settings** step, mark any reporter that does not publish monthly data as *Unreported*. |\n| **Intraflows** | Controls whether intra‑regional trades (e.g., France ↔ Germany) appear as separate flows or are hidden. | Define intraflows in the **Trade Matrix configuration** – enable for regions where you want to focus on inter‑regional trade only. |\n| **View Type** | Determines the time granularity of the output. | Choose **Monthly** for detailed pattern spotting, **Quarterly** for seasonal trends, or **Yearly** for long‑term outlooks. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Set Up Forecast Scenarios  \n\n1. Click **“Choose Default Forecasts”**.  \n2. Create at least three scenarios:  \n   * **Conservative** – lower bound of expected shipments.  \n   * **Expected** – baseline projection (often the statistical median).  \n   * **Optimistic** – upper bound of potential shipments.  \n3. Assign each scenario to the relevant **crop year** (e.g., **2024/25**).  \n\n> **Why:** Forecasts let you run “what‑if” analyses and compare outcomes side‑by‑side.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Apply Filters & Generate the Pivot Table  \n\n1. **Data Filters** – Use the filter bar to slice by:  \n   * **Reporter region** (e.g., *Americas*).  \n   * **Partner region** (e.g., *Asia*).  \n   * **Time period** (specific months or quarters).  \n2. **Pivot Layout** – Drag the following fields into the pivot:  \n   * **Rows:** Reporter → Partner → Product.  \n   * **Columns:** Time (Month/Quarter).  \n   * **Values:** Quantity (tons) – set aggregation to **Sum**.  \n3. Click **Refresh**. The matrix now displays the trade volumes for the selected configuration.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Analyse the Results  \n\n- **Trend spotting:** Look for spikes or drops in monthly volumes; compare against previous crop years.  \n- **Benchmark vs. Reference:** Overlay official customs data (benchmark) with your forecast or other reference datasets to spot discrepancies.  \n- **Intraflow impact:** Toggle the intraflow setting to see how much intra‑regional trade is influencing total volumes.  \n- **Unreported contribution:** Highlight unreported reporters to understand the share of estimated data in the overall picture.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Export & Share  \n\n1. Use the **Export** button to download the pivot table as **Excel** or **CSV**.  \n2. Save the matrix as a **custom tab** (click the “+” next to the tab bar) for quick re‑use.  \n3. Optionally, create a **dashboard** with charts (line, bar, heat‑map) that reference the saved matrix.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them  \n\n| Issue | Cause | Fix |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| **No data appears** | Filters too restrictive or wrong dataset selected. | Reset filters, verify that at least one reporter/partner/product is selected, and confirm the dataset is active. |\n| **Forecast values are blank** | Forecast not assigned to the selected crop year or reporter. | Re‑enter the forecast step and ensure each reporter has a forecast linked to the correct crop year. |\n| **Intraflows still showing** | Intraflow definition not saved in the Trade Matrix configuration. | Re‑open **Settings → Intraflows**, confirm the region groups, and click **Save** before refreshing. |\n| **Unreported data inflates totals** | Unreported reporters unintentionally included in the main view. | Move those reporters to a separate folder and deselect the folder when you need “official‑only” totals. |\n\n---\n\n### 10. Next Steps  \n\n- **Scenario comparison:** Duplicate the matrix, change the forecast assumptions, and place the two matrices side‑by‑side to quantify risk exposure.  \n- **Seasonality analysis:** Switch the view type to **Quarterly** and add a **"

the script fetches the CSV and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.\n\n6. **Use the DataFrame** – You can now analyse, filter, or export the data as needed.\n\n### Common pitfalls\n\n- **Invalid token** – The request will return `401`. Verify the token is current and not expired.  \n- **Wrong TradeMatrix code** – Ensure you copy the exact code from the platform URL or the “Code” column.  \n- **Missing forecast codes** – If you request forecasts that are not loaded in the TradeMatrix, the API may return an error; list only the forecasts you have loaded.  \n- **Timeout** – Very large TradeMatrices may need more than the default 30 seconds; increase the `timeout` argument in `_wait_for_task` if necessary.\n\nFeel free to adapt the payload (e.g., change `strategy` to `\"exclude\"` or request `json`/`xlsx` output) to match your specific use case."

        "question": "What does SHEX mean in freight terms?",
        "target_answer": "**SHEX** means **Sundays and Holidays Excluded**. It's a contractual term where Sundays and public holidays do not count toward the allowed laytime for loading or discharging cargo.",
        "model_response": "**SHEX – Sundays and Holidays Excluded**\n\nIn freight contracts, **SHEX** is a laytime term that tells you which days are **not counted** as working days for loading or discharging cargo.\n\n- **Definition:** Sundays and public holidays are **excluded** from the laytime calculation.  \n- **Effect:** If the agreed laytime is, for example, **5 days SHEX** and a Sunday falls within that period, the Sunday is **skipped** and does not reduce the remaining laytime. The charterer gets an extra calendar day to complete the operation.  \n- **Typical use:** Common in regions where ports are closed on Sundays (or where local holidays are observed) and the parties want to reflect the actual working days available.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- Ensures fair cost allocation by matching laytime to the days when the port is actually operational.  \n- Prevents disputes over “lost” time on non‑working days.  \n- Helps in accurate voyage planning and budgeting.  \n\nIf you need further clarification on how SHEX interacts with other terms (e.g., **SHINC** – Sundays and Holidays Included, or **FHEX** – Fridays and Holidays Excluded), feel free to ask."

        "question": "How do I filter data in the Freight Rates table?",
        "target_answer": "Click the **filter icon (⏷)** on any column header to open a filter menu for that column. You can also use the global **Search Bar** for keyword searches, or the **Filter Panel** (top right) to save and load complex filter combinations.",
        "model_response": "**How to Filter Data in the Freight Rates Table**\n\nBelow is a quick, step‑by‑step guide to narrow the freight‑rate view to exactly the records you need.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n- You are logged into the DNEXT platform with access to the **Net Freight Rates** module.  \n- A dataset (e.g., *Daily Freight Rates (DNEXR)*) is already loaded.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Open the Freight Rates Table\n1. From the DNEXT home page, navigate **Freight → Net Freight Rates**.  \n2. The table loads automatically with the default dataset.\n\n### 2. Choose the Spot Date (optional but recommended)\n1. Click the **Spot Date** calendar icon at the top‑center of the screen.  \n2. Pick the date for which you want to see rates (e.g., 2025‑11‑03).  \n3. The table refreshes to show only rates valid on that date.\n\n### 3. Select a Batch (optional)\n1. Click **Select Batch** on the top bar.  \n2. Choose a batch name from the dropdown list.  \n3. The table now displays only the records belonging to that batch.\n\n### 4. Apply Column‑Specific Filters\n1. Locate the **filter icon** (🔍) on the column you wish to filter (e.g., *Commodity*, *Vessel Type*, *Port*, *Routing*).  \n2. Click the icon – a small filter panel appears.  \n3. Enter your filter criteria:\n   - **Text match** – type part of the name (e.g., “Soybean”, “Suez”).  \n   - **Exact match** – select from the dropdown list if available.  \n   - **Numeric range** – specify a minimum and/or maximum rate value.  \n4. Press **Enter** or click **Apply**.  \n5. The table instantly updates to show only rows that meet the condition.\n\n### 5. Combine Multiple Filters\n- Repeat step 4 on additional columns.  \n- Filters are **cumulative** – each new filter further narrows the result set.  \n\n### 6. Save a Filter Set (Filter Panel)\nIf you frequently use the same combination of filters:\n\n1. Click the **Filters** button at the top‑right of the table.  \n2. In the **Filter Panel**, give the filter set a descriptive name (e.g., “Soybean Suez Nov‑2025”).  \n3. Click **Save**.  \n4. Later, you can reload this saved filter set from the same **Filters** menu.\n\n### 7. Clear Filters\n- To remove a single filter, click the **X** next to the filter value in the column header.  \n- To clear all filters at once, open the **Filters** menu and choose **Clear All**.\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls & Tips\n- **Spot Date vs. Batch** – If you select a batch that was created for a different spot date, the table may show no rows. Always align the spot date with the batch’s intended date.  \n- **Case Sensitivity** – The search bar and column filters are case‑insensitive, but exact‑match dropdowns may list values in a specific case; typing the full name avoids mismatches.  \n- **Saving Filters** – Saved filters are user‑specific. If you need to share a filter set with a colleague, they must recreate it in their own account.  \n\n---\n\n**Result:** After completing these steps, the Freight Rates table will display only the records that match your chosen criteria, allowing you to focus analysis on the exact commodities, routes, vessels, or dates you need.  \n\nIf you encounter any unexpected behavior (e.g., filters not applying), please reach out to **support@dnext.io** for assistance."

        "model_response": "**Configuring Priority Rules for Multiple Time Periods**\n\nWhen you need different datasets (or forecasts) to be used for distinct, non‑overlapping time ranges, follow the **Multiple Defined Periods** workflow (Option B). This gives you full control over which data source drives the matrix in each period.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Trade matrix already created** – you must be in the matrix’s configuration view.  \n2. **Datasets available** – the required source files (e.g., official customs, estimates, forecasts) must be loaded in the system.  \n3. **No overlapping periods** – each period you define must be exclusive; overlapping ranges will be ignored.\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step Guide\n\n1. **Open Priority Rules**\n   - In the matrix view, click the **Configuration** (gear) button.  \n   - Choose **Priority Rules**. The page shows a list of reporters (e.g., United States, Brazil).\n\n2. **Select the Reporter to Edit**\n   - Click the reporter name whose time‑period rules you want to set (e.g., **United States**).\n\n3. **Add a New Period Configuration**\n   - Locate the **Periods** section (usually a tab or “+ Add Period” button).  \n   - Click **+ Add Period**. A new panel appears with four sections: **Datasets & Forecasts**, **SND**, **As Reference**, and **Finalization Settings**.\n\n4. **Define the Time Range**\n   - In the period header, set the **Start** and **End** dates (e.g., `2020‑01‑01` to `2022‑12‑31`).  \n   - Ensure the range does **not** overlap any existing period for this reporter.\n\n5. **Assign Datasets & Forecasts**\n   - **Datasets & Forecasts**: Click **+ Add Dataset** or **+ Add Forecast** and pick the appropriate source from the dropdown (e.g., “USA Census Bureau Export Data”, “USA Export Estimates 2024”).  \n   - The selected items appear in the **Available** list.\n\n6. **Choose the Benchmark (SND)**\n   - Drag the dataset you want to display as the primary value into the **SND** section.  \n   - Only one dataset can occupy SND for a given period; this becomes the main data shown in the pivot table.\n\n7. **Set a Reference Dataset (optional)**\n   - If you need a comparison column (yellow‑highlighted in the matrix), drag a dataset into the **As Reference** section.  \n   - Typical uses: previous‑year official data, preliminary vs. revised data, etc.\n\n8. **Configure Finalization Settings**\n   - For each dataset in **SND** and **As Reference**, click its **Finalization** dropdown and choose:\n     - **Never Finalized** – values stay editable/forecastable (good for future years).  \n     - **Always Finalized** – values are locked (historical official data).  \n     - **Conditional** – set criteria (Publication Date, Shipment Date, or User Validation) that automatically lock the data when met.  \n   - A common pattern:\n     - **Historical periods** → *Always Finalized*  \n     - **Current year** → *Conditional – Publication Date*  \n     - **Future periods** → *Never Finalized* (allows forecasting)\n\n9. **Save the Period**\n   - Click **Save** (or the check‑mark icon) on the period panel.  \n   - The new period now appears in the list under the reporter.\n\n10. **Repeat for Additional Periods**\n    - Add as many non‑overlapping periods as needed, each with its own dataset, reference, and finalization settings.\n\n11. **Refresh the Matrix**\n    - Return to the main matrix view.  \n    - Click the **Refresh Data** button (🔄) and wait for the success message.  \n    - Verify that the correct data appears for each time slice.\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them\n\n| Issue | Why It Happens | Fix |\n|-------|----------------|-----|\n| **No data appears** | Periods overlap or the selected dataset does not cover the defined dates. | Ensure each period’s range is unique and that the dataset’s coverage includes the entire range. |\n| **Reference columns stay empty** | No dataset placed in **As Reference**, or the reference dataset lacks data for the period. | Drag a suitable dataset into **As Reference** and confirm its time coverage. |\n| **Forecast cells are grey** | Finalization set to *Always Finalized* for the current period. | Change to *Conditional* (e.g., Publication Date) or *Never Finalized* for future periods. |\n| **Unexpected dataset shown** | Multiple datasets placed in SND for the same period (overlap). | Keep only one dataset in SND per period; move extras to **Available** or **Reference**. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap (Bullet Form)\n\n- **Configuration → Priority Rules → Reporter → Add Period**  \n- Set **non‑overlapping date range**.  \n- **Add Dataset(s)** → drag the primary one to **SND**.  \n- (Optional) drag a comparison dataset to **As Reference**.  \n- Choose appropriate **Finalization** (Never, Always, Conditional).  \n- **Save** → **Refresh Data** to see results.\n\nFollowing these steps lets you tailor the data source for each historical, current, or future window, ensuring the trade matrix always displays the most relevant benchmark and reference information."

The most common reasons are:\n\n| Possible cause | What to check |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| **No market data for the spot date** | The selected spot date may not have published rates. |\n| **Dataset does not contain the route or commodity** | The active dataset might be missing the required route, commodity or forward month. |\n| **Freight configuration is incomplete** | Required input datasets (e.g., Bunkers Spot, Port Distances, Forward Codes) are not linked or are outdated. |\n| **Estimates need recalculation** | The calculation status shows “pending” or “failed”. |\n| **Forward month not yet released** | Some forward columns (Nov, Dec, etc.) may be empty until the market publishes them. |\n\n---\n\n## Step‑by‑step troubleshooting\n\n1. **Verify the spot date**  \n   - Click the **Spot Date** picker (top centre).  \n   - Choose a recent date you know has market activity (e.g., yesterday).  \n   - If rates appear, the original date simply lacked data.\n\n2. **Confirm the active dataset**  \n   - Open the **Freight Configuration** (⚙️ button).  \n   - In the **Input Datasets** section, ensure a valid dataset is selected for each required item (Bunkers Spot, Port Distances, Forward Codes, etc.).  \n   - Make sure the dataset is **active** and contains records for the chosen spot date.\n\n3. **Check route and commodity coverage**  \n   - Use the **Search Bar** or column filters to locate a known route/commodity that should have data (e.g., “Soybean – Rotterdam to Guangzhou”).  \n   - If the row is missing, the dataset does not cover that route; select a different dataset or add the missing route to the source data.\n\n4. **Inspect calculation status**  \n   - Look for a status indicator on each estimate row (often a small icon or colour).  \n   - If it shows **pending** or **failed**, trigger a **Re‑calculate** (bulk calculate or single‑row recalc).  \n   - After the calculation finishes, the rate columns should populate.\n\n5. **Validate forward month availability**  \n   - Some forward columns (e.g., “Jan 2026”) may be empty because the market has not published those rates yet.  \n   - Switch to an earlier forward month that is known to be released, or wait until the data is available.\n\n6. **Clear any active filters**  \n   - Click the **Filters** button (top right) and select **Reset** to remove hidden constraints that might be excluding rows with data.\n\n7. **Refresh the page**  \n   - Press **Ctrl + F5** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac) to force a full reload. This clears any cached view that could be causing the blank cells.\n\n---\n\n## Common pitfalls to avoid\n\n- **Selecting a batch that has no records** – if a batch filter is applied, only that batch’s rows are shown; an empty batch yields empty columns.  \n- **Using an outdated dataset** – datasets are refreshed on a schedule; an old snapshot may lack recent spot dates.  \n- **Leaving the “Forward Codes” dataset unset** – without forward codes the system cannot compute forward month rates.  \n\n---\n\nIf after completing the steps above the rate columns are still empty, the issue is likely data‑side (e.g., missing market feed) and will need assistance from the data‑management team.  \n\n**Next step:** Open a support ticket with a screenshot of the empty table, the spot date you are using, and the name of the active dataset. Include any error messages from the **Changes/Logs** panel if you attempted a recalculation.  \n\nFor further help, please contact **support@dnext.io**."

        "target_answer": "In the estimate edit page, go to the **Itinerary Section**. Add a new row, select **Port Status** (Load, Discharge, Top Off, etc.), specify **Port Name**, and fill in other details. The system automatically creates corresponding rows in Sea Passage and Port Stay panels.",
        "model_response": "**Adding a New Port to a Freight‑Estimate Itinerary**\n\nBelow is the recommended workflow for inserting an additional port into an existing freight estimate. The steps assume you already have an estimate opened in the **Net Freight Rates** module and the necessary edit permissions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n1. **Access rights** – You must be able to *Edit* estimates (usually a “Freight Analyst” or higher role).  \n2. **Dataset & Batch** – The estimate you are editing should be loaded from the correct dataset and, if applicable, the appropriate batch is selected.  \n3. **Port reference** – The new port must exist in the system’s master port list (otherwise you’ll receive a validation error when you try to save).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Open the Estimate for Editing\n1. From the top navigation, click **Estimates** (⚙️ Freight Configuration → Estimates).  \n2. Locate the estimate you want to modify (use the search bar or filter panel if needed).  \n3. Click the **Edit** icon (pencil) next to the estimate row. The **Estimate Overview** screen appears.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Navigate to the Itinerary Section\n1. In the right‑hand pane of the Overview screen, scroll down to **Itinerary Section**.  \n2. You will see a table/list of the current ports with columns such as **Port Status**, **Sea Passage**, **Draft**, **Zone**, **Time**, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Add the New Port\n| Action | How‑to |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Insert a row** | Click the **“+ Add Port”** button (usually located above the itinerary table). |\n| **Select the port** | In the new row, click the **Port** dropdown and choose the desired port from the list. |\n| **Set Port Status** | Choose the appropriate status (e.g., *Load*, *Discharge*, *Lay‑over*). |\n| **Enter Sea Passage** | Provide the numeric sea‑passage duration (hours or days) for the leg that leads to this port. |\n| **Specify Draft** | Input the draft value under the **Draft** tab (numeric input). |\n| **Choose Zone** | Use the **Zone** tab to select the categorical zone that applies to the port (e.g., *Zone A*, *Zone B*). |\n| **Review Time** | The **Time** tab is read‑only; it will auto‑calculate once the sea‑passage and draft are entered. |\n| **Bunker & Consumption** (optional) | If the port has specific bunker consumption, fill the **Bkr Cons** tab; otherwise leave it blank. |\n\n*Tip:* After entering the sea‑passage and draft, the **Time** and **Bkr Cons** fields update automatically. Verify the values before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Save the Changes\n1. Click **“Save”** (or **“Apply”**) at the bottom of the Estimate Overview screen.  \n2. A confirmation toast will appear, and the itinerary table will now list the newly added port in the correct sequence.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Verify the Updated Itinerary\n1. Re‑open the estimate (or stay on the same screen) and scroll through the itinerary to ensure the new port appears in the intended order.  \n2. Check that the **Total Duration**, **Total Voyage Cost**, and any downstream calculations (e.g., Net TCE) reflect the added leg.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them\n- **Port not found** – If the dropdown does not contain the desired port, the master port list must be updated by an admin.  \n- **Incorrect sea‑passage value** – Entering a value that is too low/high can cause the auto‑calculated **Time** to be unrealistic; double‑check with route planners.  \n- **Missing draft/zone** – Leaving these fields blank will prevent the system from computing fuel consumption and may trigger validation errors on save.  \n- **Sequence errors** – Ports are ordered as entered; if the new port should be in the middle of the itinerary, drag‑and‑drop (if supported) or re‑order manually by editing the sequence numbers.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Quick Checklist Before Closing\n- [ ] New port selected from the master list.  \n- [ ] Correct **Port Status** assigned.  \n- [ ] Sea‑passage, Draft, and Zone filled.  \n- [ ] Auto‑calculated **Time** looks reasonable.  \n- [ ] Estimate saved without error messages.  \n\n---\n\nIf you encounter any validation errors that are not covered here, or you need assistance updating the master port list, please contact **support@dnext.io**."

        "model_response": "**Intraflows** are a specific type of trade‑flow relationship that you define inside a Trade Matrix.  \n\n- **What they represent** – An intraflow is a **Reporter → Partner** pair that you want to treat as an internal or “within‑system” movement rather than a regular export/import. Typical examples are:\n  * A country exporting to itself (e.g., **USA → USA**) to capture domestic redistribution.\n  * A regional hub moving goods to another hub that you consider part of the same supply‑chain network.  \n\n- **Why they matter** – Intraflows can be shown or hidden independently of the normal export/import data. This lets you:\n  * Exclude internal transfers from total export/import totals when you only need cross‑border figures.  \n  * Include them when you need a complete picture of all movements, including domestic reallocations.  \n\n- **How they are configured** – In the Trade Matrix **Settings** tab you list every Reporter‑Partner combination that should be treated as an intraflow. The system then:\n  * Recognises the direction based on the matrix **Mode** (Export vs. Import).  \n  * Applies the “Intraflows” toggle in **View Settings** so you can show or hide those rows on demand.  \n\n- **Common pitfalls**  \n  * **Mismatch with Mode** – If the matrix is set to **Export**, “USA → Canada” is interpreted as an export from the USA. The same pair in an **Import** matrix is interpreted as an import into the USA. Make sure the direction matches your chosen mode.  \n  * **Missing combination** – If a Reporter‑Partner pair isn’t listed in the Intraflows section, it will appear as a regular flow and cannot be toggled with the Intraflows button.  \n  * **Data‑scope settings** – After adding or removing intraflows, refresh the view or re‑apply the Data Scope settings to see the change.  \n\n### Quick configuration checklist\n\n1. **Open Settings** – Click the **Configuration** button on the Trade Matrix toolbar and select the **Settings** tab.  \n2. **Add intraflow pairs** – In the **Intraflows** section, click **Add** and choose the Reporter and Partner for each internal flow (e.g., *USA → USA*, *France → Germany*).  \n3. **Save** – Confirm the list and close the Settings dialog.  \n4. **Toggle visibility** – In **View Settings** (⚙️), use the **Intraflows** switch to show or hide those rows in the pivot table.  \n\nBy correctly defining and managing intraflows, you gain precise control over whether internal or domestic movements are part of your trade analysis.

        "model_response": "**Why some cells in your Trade Matrix cannot be forecasted**\n\nWhen a cell stays empty or shows “‑” after you click **Forecasts**, it means the matrix does not have any *forecast‑capable* data for that particular Reporter → Partner → Product combination. The most common reasons are listed below, together with the actions you need to take to resolve them.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Forecasting must be enabled at the matrix level  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| The **Forecastable** checkbox in *General Settings* is unchecked. | Open the matrix **General Settings** (gear icon → *General Settings*). Tick **Forecastable** and **Save**. All cells will now be eligible for forecasting, provided the underlying data also supports it. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. No forecast‑capable dataset is assigned to the reporter  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| The pivot shows historic values but the **Forecast** button is disabled or produces no rows for a given reporter. | 1. Go to **Priority Rules** (bottom‑right button on the matrix view). <br>2. Select the affected **Reporter**. <br>3. In the **SND (benchmark)** section, add at least one dataset that contains *future* values (e.g., “USA Export Estimates 2024”). <br>4. Optionally add a **Reference** dataset for comparison. <br>5. Click **Save**. |\n|   | *Why it matters*: Only datasets that have a **Publication Date = “Future years: Never Finalized”** (i.e., they contain forecast data) can populate forecast cells. Historical datasets that are already finalized cannot be used for forecasting. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. The selected period does not cover the forecast horizon  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| Your matrix **Period** ends before the first month you want to forecast (e.g., Period = 2020‑2024 but you try to forecast 2025). | Edit the matrix **General Settings** → **Period** and extend the range to include the desired future months/years. The **View** range can stay narrower; only the **Period** must encompass the forecast horizon. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Forecasts have not been chosen as default for the reporter  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| The **Forecasts** button opens but no forecast rows appear. | In **Priority Rules**, after adding a forecast‑capable dataset, click the **Forecasts** tab (or the “Select forecasts to be loaded by default” section in the matrix creation wizard). Tick the forecast dataset(s) you want to appear automatically. Save the changes. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cell belongs to an **Intraflow** or **Unreported** reporter that lacks forecasts  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| Cells for “Rest of World” or for reporters marked as **Unreported** stay empty when you try to forecast. | 1. In **Settings** → **Define Intraflows** and **Define Unreported Reporters**, make sure you have added at least one forecast dataset for those reporters. <br>2. If no forecast data exists for a given intraflow/unreported reporter, forecasting is impossible – you will need to import or create a forecast dataset for that reporter. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Data filters are hiding the forecast rows  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| Forecast rows exist in the backend but are not visible in the pivot. | Check the **Data Filters** (top‑right filter bar). Ensure that: <br>• **Reporter**, **Partner**, **Product**, and **Month/Crop Year** filters include the forecast period. <br>• **Data Scope** toggles (Intraflows, Unreported) are set to *On* if you need those rows. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Priority rules are missing for the reporter  \n\n| Symptom | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| Entire rows for a reporter are blank, both historic and forecast. | The matrix will not display any data for a reporter that has **no priority rule** configured. Open **Priority Rules**, add the reporter, assign at least one dataset (historical or forecast) and save. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist  \n\n1. **General Settings** – Forecastable ✅, Period includes future dates.  \n2. **Priority Rules** – Every reporter has at least one dataset in the **SND** section.  \n3. **Forecast Datasets** – At least one dataset with “Future years: Never Finalized” is selected for the reporter.  \n4. **Default Forecasts** – Chosen in the **Forecasts** tab of Priority Rules.  \n5. **Filters** – No filter is excluding the future months or the reporter/partner you are looking at.  \n6. **Intraflows / Unreported** – If you need those rows, ensure they have forecast datasets assigned.  \n\nIf after verifying all the items above the cells are still not forecastable, the underlying data simply does not contain any forecast values for that combination. In that case you will need to **import or create a forecast dataset** for the missing reporter‑partner‑product.\n\n---\n\n### What to do next  \n\n1.

        "model_response": "**TCE (Time‑Charter Equivalent)**  \n\n- **What it is:**  \n  TCE is a performance metric that converts the earnings from a freight voyage into a **standardized daily rate**. It lets you compare the profitability of different voyages or scenarios on an equal‑per‑day basis, regardless of vessel size, route length, or cargo volume.\n\n- **Why it matters:**  \n  - Provides a single, easy‑to‑interpret figure for **daily earnings**.  \n  - Enables side‑by‑side comparison of multiple voyage options, market conditions, or speed strategies (full vs. eco).  \n  - Helps assess the impact of changes to freight rates, commissions, bunker costs, or voyage duration on overall profitability.\n\n- **How it’s calculated:**  \n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Net TCE} = \\frac{ \\big( \\text{Final Intake} \\times (\\text{FIO Rate} \\times (1 - \\text{Com Amount})) \\big) - \\text{Total Voyage Cost} }{ \\text{Total Duration} }\n  \\]\n\n  Where:  \n  - **Final Intake** – Shipped tonnage after intake limits/adjustments.  \n  - **FIO Rate** – Contracted Free‑In/Out freight rate per metric ton.  \n  - **Com Amount** – Commission percentage (derived from *Add Com %*).  \n  - **Total Voyage Cost** – All operating costs (bunkers, ports & misc, hire if included).  \n  - **Total Duration** – Total number of days the vessel is on the voyage.\n\n- **Key points to remember:**  \n  1. **Accuracy of inputs** – Ensure *Total Duration* and *Total Voyage Cost* are finalized before interpreting TCE.  \n  2. **Real‑time updates** – Changing the FIO Rate or commission percentage instantly recalculates Net TCE.  \n  3. **Normalization** – Because the result is expressed per day ($/D), you can compare voyages of different lengths or speeds directly.\n\nIn practice, you’ll see **Net TCE** displayed on the freight estimate screen alongside Gross Freight, Net Freight, and Net Result, giving you a quick snapshot of the voyage’s daily earning power."

        "model_response": "**Why Your Bulk Calculate Is Failing**\n\nThe Bulk Calculate feature can fail for several reasons that are usually easy to resolve. Follow the checklist below to pinpoint the cause and get the operation running again.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Verify the Input Parameters  \n\n| Parameter | What to check |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **VC / TC Datasets** | Both datasets must exist, be active, and be accessible to your user role. |\n| **Spot Dates** | The selected spot dates need market data for the forward months you are calculating. |\n| **Month Factors** | Ensure the Current‑Month and Near‑Month factors are set (they can be 0 if you don’t want a multiplier). |\n| **Execution Type** | Choose the correct cadence (Daily or Friday) for the dates you supplied. |\n\n*If any of these are missing or point to an empty dataset, the run will abort.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reduce the Batch Size  \n\nBulk runs that include many batches often hit time‑outs.\n\n1. **Open the batch filter panel.**  \n2. **Select a smaller subset** (e.g., 5‑10 batches).  \n3. **Run Bulk Calculate** again.  \n\nIf the reduced set succeeds, the original failure was due to size. You can then:\n\n- Split the full list into several smaller runs, **or**  \n- Increase the server‑side timeout (requires admin assistance).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Process Batches Sequentially  \n\nRunning all batches in parallel can expose a single problematic estimate that stops the whole job.\n\n1. **Deselect “All Batches”.**  \n2. **Pick one batch** and start Bulk Calculate.  \n3. **Inspect the result** – if it succeeds, move to the next batch.  \n\nWhen a batch fails, open the **Changes/Logs** tab of the offending estimate to see the exact error (e.g., missing vessel data, invalid port‑term, or absent market rates).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Confirm Market Data Availability  \n\n- **Spot Date** – Verify that the spot date you chose actually has published rates. Try a different recent date as a sanity check.  \n- **Forward Months** – Some forward months may not yet be released; the calculation will stop if it can’t find rates for those months.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Check Your Network  \n\nA stable connection is required while the system queues and processes the calculations.\n\n- Use a wired connection or a reliable Wi‑Fi network.  \n- Avoid heavy bandwidth activities (large file downloads, video streaming) during the run.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Pre‑flight Checklist (Run Before Every Bulk Calculate)\n\n1. **Freight Configuration** – Ensure all required datasets are up‑to‑date and priority rules are correct.  \n2. **Estimate Inputs** – Verify vessel profile, itinerary, and port terms for every estimate in scope.  \n3. **Batch Filters** – Apply precise filters (client, creator, date) so you only target the intended records.  \n4. **Clear Stale Filters** – Reset any leftover UI filters that might hide data.  \n\nRunning this quick audit prevents most failures.\n\n---\n\n### 7. If the Problem Persists  \n\n- **Identify the failing estimate** via its **Changes/Logs** entry and correct the specific data issue (e.g., missing bunker price, invalid port compatibility).  \n- **Contact support** with the batch IDs, selected datasets, spot dates, and any error messages you see in the logs.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Recap**\n\n- ✅ Verify VC/TC datasets and spot dates.  \n- ✅ Reduce batch size or run batches one‑by‑one.  \n- ✅ Ensure market data exists for all forward months.  \n- ✅ Keep a stable internet connection.  \n- ✅ Perform the pre‑flight checklist before each run.\n\nFollowing these steps should resolve the majority of Bulk Calculate failures.

Consider bookmarking the production URL as a backup.\n- **Naming collisions** – Two tabs with the same name will overwrite each other. Use unique, descriptive names.\n- **Changing filters after saving** – If you modify filters while the custom tab is active, those changes are **not** saved automatically. Re‑open the tab or re‑save it if you need the new configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Result:** You now have a custom tab that instantly restores your preferred combination of filters, conversions, and display settings, speeding up repetitive analysis tasks in the Production view."

        "model_response": "**Why Your Freight‑Rates Filters Appear to Do Nothing**\n\nWhen a filter is applied but the table still shows the same rows, the most common causes are:\n\n| Potential cause | What to check / fix |\n|-----------------|----------------------|\n| **Filters are still active from a previous session** | Use the **filter reset button** (usually a small “x” or “Clear All” icon) to remove every active filter, then re‑apply the one you need. |\n| **Filter text does not match the data exactly** | Filters are **case‑sensitive** in several columns. Verify the spelling, spacing and capitalisation of the value you type (e.g., “Soybean” vs “soybean”). |\n| **Multiple filters are being combined incorrectly** | Filters work as **AND** conditions – every filter must match a row. If you add a second filter that has no overlapping rows, the result will be empty (or appear unchanged). Test each filter **one at a time** to confirm it works before stacking them. |\n| **Spot‑date or dataset has no data** | The table only shows rates that exist for the selected **Spot Date** and **Dataset**. If the chosen date has no market data, the filter engine has nothing to narrow down. Try a different spot date or switch to a dataset you know contains data. |\n| **A batch is locked in** | If a **Batch** is selected, only rates from that batch are displayed, which can make a filter seem ineffective. Clear the batch selection to return to the full view. |\n| **Browser cache or stale UI state** | Occasionally the UI keeps an old filter state. Click the **Refresh** button on the table (or press **F5 / Ctrl‑R**) and, if the problem persists, clear the browser cache and reload the page. |\n| **Network hiccup while applying the filter** | A momentary loss of connectivity can prevent the filter request from reaching the server. Verify your internet connection and try again. |\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step Troubleshooting Guide\n\n1. **Reset the filter panel**  \n   - Click the **Filters** button (top‑right of the table).  \n   - Press the **Clear All** (or “reset”) icon.  \n   - Confirm that the table returns to its unfiltered state.\n\n2. **Confirm dataset & spot date**  \n   - Open the **Spot Date Picker** and choose a date you know has market data (e.g., a recent business day).  \n   - Verify that a valid **Dataset** is selected in the configuration bar.  \n\n3. **Apply a single, simple filter**  \n   - In the filter row of the column you want (e.g., *Commodity*), type the exact value **including correct case** (e.g., `Soybean`).  \n   - Press **Enter** or click the apply icon.  \n   - The table should instantly shrink to matching rows.\n\n4. **Test additional filters one at a time**  \n   - Add a second filter only after the first one works.  \n   - Remember that both conditions must be true for a row to appear.  \n\n5. **Refresh the data view**  \n   - Click the **Refresh** button (usually a circular arrow near the table header).  \n   - If the UI still looks wrong, press **Ctrl + F5** (or **Cmd + Shift + R**) to force a full page reload.\n\n6. **Clear browser cache if needed**  \n   - Open your browser’s settings → **Privacy & Security** → **Clear browsing data** → select **Cached images and files** → **Clear**.  \n   - Reload the Freight Rates module and repeat steps 1‑4.\n\n7. **Check network stability**  \n   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection while applying filters.  \n   - If you notice timeouts or “failed to load” messages, resolve the network issue before retrying.\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Using partial or miss‑spelled values** – the filter will be ignored.  \n- **Assuming filters are OR logic** – they are AND; all conditions must be satisfied.  \n- **Leaving a batch selected** – it limits the data set and can mask filter effects.  \n- **Applying filters before the spot‑date data loads** – wait for the table to finish loading (spinner disappears) before typing filter criteria.  \n\n---\n\nIf you have followed the steps above and the filters still do not behave as expected, there may be a deeper configuration issue (e.g., missing input datasets in Freight Configuration) or a system‑wide bug. In that case, please reach out to the support team with:\n\n- Your user ID  \n- The spot date and dataset you are using  \n- Screenshots of the filter panel and the table view  \n\n**Contact:** support@dnext.io  \n\nThey will investigate the logs and provide a targeted fix."

        "model_response": "**Vessel draft is a key driver of the intake calculation for each port call.**  \n\nWhen you open the **Intake** tab the system shows two read‑only results:\n\n| Field | What it shows | How draft is used |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Calculated intake (MT)** | The tonnage the model expects the vessel to take on at this stop. | The value is **derived** from the vessel’s current draft together with the port’s zone constraints and the vessel‑configuration settings. |\n| **Maximum allowable intake (MT)** | The upper limit that the port permits for this call. | It is computed from **local draft/berth limits** and other vessel characteristics (e.g., length, LOA, draft‑dependent depth restrictions). |\n\n### How draft influences the numbers\n\n1. **Draft‑based depth checks** – The system compares the vessel’s draft (including ballast, cargo, and any under‑keel clearance) against the port’s depth profile for the selected zone.  \n2. **Zone constraints** – Some ports have multiple draft zones (e.g., shallow vs. deep). The draft determines which zone the vessel can use, and each zone has its own intake ceiling.  \n3. **Berth limits** – If the draft exceeds the berth’s permissible draft, the **Maximum allowable intake** is reduced to keep the vessel within safe limits.  \n4. **Configuration rules** – Vessel‑specific rules (e.g., draft‑dependent cargo density limits) are applied automatically, further shaping the **Calculated intake**.\n\n### Practical impact\n\n- **Higher draft** → tighter depth/berth restrictions → lower **Maximum allowable intake** → the model may suggest a reduced cargo load to stay within safe limits.  \n- **Lower draft** (e.g., after ballast discharge) → more depth margin → higher possible intake, allowing the model to allocate more cargo tonnage.\n\n### Quick check workflow\n\n1. **Enter/verify vessel draft** in the itinerary or vessel profile.  \n2. Navigate to the **Intake** tab.  \n3. Review the **Calculated intake** and **Maximum allowable intake** values.  \n4. If the calculated intake exceeds the maximum, adjust the draft (e.g., by planning ballast off‑loading) or select a different port zone to achieve the desired cargo load.\n\n**Bottom line:** Draft determines the depth and berth constraints that the system uses to compute both the *allowable* and *actual* intake tonnage for a port stop. Adjusting draft directly changes those intake results."

        "model_response": "**Bulk Calculate** is a feature in the Net Freight Rates module that lets you re‑run freight‑rate calculations for many estimates at once, without opening each estimate individually.\n\n### What it does\n- **Re‑calculates** freight values for a selected set of batches (or for all batches that are not currently running if no batch is chosen).  \n- Queues the recalculations as background jobs, so you can continue working while the runs progress.  \n- Updates each batch’s status and timestamps as the runs complete, giving you a clear view of success or failure.\n\n### When to use it\n- After you have changed market datasets, month‑factor settings, or other configuration that affects many estimates.  \n- When you need to produce a repeatable analysis trail (record the VC/TC datasets and month‑factor values used).  \n- To apply a new pricing logic (e.g., different **Current‑Month** or **Near‑Month** factors) across a whole client, date range, or shipment group.\n\n### How to run Bulk Calculate\n1. **Select a batch** (optional).  \n   - If you leave the batch field empty, the action will target *all* batches that are not currently running.  \n2. Click **Bulk Calculate** → a dialog appears with run parameters.  \n3. **Set the parameters**:  \n   - **VC Dataset** – dataset for virtual/visible calculations.  \n   - **TC Dataset** – dataset for test/time‑charter output (or configured TC target).  \n   - **Spot Dates** – one or more dates that will be used as the pricing position for every estimate in scope.  \n   - **Current‑Month Factor (%)** – factor applied to the current‑month pricing logic.  \n   - **Near‑Month Factor (%)** – factor applied to the next‑month forward logic.  \n   - **Execution Type** – choose **Daily** (run using each spot date’s daily settings) or **Friday** (run using end‑of‑week pricing cadence).  \n4. **Submit** the dialog. The system queues the recalculations.  \n5. **Monitor** batch status and the “last run” timestamps. If any run fails, inspect the individual estimate’s **Changes/Logs** for details.\n\n### Operational tips\n- **Pre‑flight checks**: Verify that your Freight Configuration datasets and priority rules are up‑to‑date before launching a bulk run.  \n- **Scope carefully**: Use batch filters (client, creator, date, etc.) to limit the run to only the estimates you intend to recalculate.  \n- **Record parameters**: Keep a note of the VC/TC datasets and month‑factor values used; this makes the analysis reproducible.  \n- **Troubleshooting**: If a run fails, check the estimate’s log for missing data, incorrect spot dates, or dataset mismatches.\n\nIn short, Bulk Calculate is the fast, centralized way to re‑price large groups of freight estimates, applying consistent market data and pricing factors while providing full visibility into run progress and results."

        "target_answer": "**Main Table** displays all freight data in structured, sortable format. Each row = freight route with commodity, vessel type, ports, routing, rate values by month. Click column headers to sort.",
        "model_response": "**Main Table – Freight Rates Module**\n\nThe **Main Table** is the central grid that appears after you open the **Net Freight Rates** module. It displays every freight record that matches the selected dataset, batch, and spot‑date filters.\n\n- **One row per freight line** – e.g., *Barley | Constanta → Cai Mep*, *Soybean | Houston → Rotterdam*, etc.  \n- **Columns** show the key attributes of each record, such as:\n  - Commodity  \n  - Origin & Destination ports (routing)  \n  - Vessel type / class  \n  - Freight terms (e.g., FOB, CIF)  \n  - Rate values for the current spot month and any additional months you have enabled (Nov, Dec, etc.)  \n  - Any custom or calculated fields you have added via the configuration panel  \n\nThe table is fully interactive:\n\n1. **Search bar** – type any keyword (commodity, port, vessel) to instantly narrow the rows.  \n2. **Column filters** – click the filter icon on a column header to apply precise criteria.  \n3. **Sorting** – click a column header to sort ascending/descending.  \n4. **Batch selector** – choosing a batch limits the rows to rates that belong to that batch only.  \n\nIn short, the Main Table is the primary view where you **explore, filter, and analyze freight rates** before creating estimates or running batch calculations."

        "question": "What are Column Definitions in Main Table?",
        "target_answer": "Columns include: **Commodity 1/2**, **Vessel**, **Intake MT**, **Load/Discharge ports**, **Routing**, **Origin**, **L. Rate/D. Rate**, **L. Term/D. Term**, **Spot/Forward columns**.",
        "model_response": "**Column Definitions in the Main Table**\n\nThe Main Table in the Freight Rates module displays one row per freight record (e.g., *Barley – Constanta → Cai Mep*). Each column provides a specific piece of information that helps you analyse and compare rates. Below are the most common columns and what they represent:\n\n| Column | Definition |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Vessel Type** | The class of vessel used for the shipment (e.g., *Panamax, Supramax, Capesize*). Determines capacity, speed, and cost structure. |\n| **Routing** | The maritime corridor the vessel follows between the load and discharge ports (e.g., *Suez, Good Hope*). Different routes affect voyage duration and price. |\n| **Freight Terms** | Contractual terms that modify how laytime is counted (e.g., **SHEX** – Sundays & holidays excluded, **FHEX** – Fridays & holidays excluded, **SHINC** – includes loading/discharging time). |\n| **Rate Values (Month 1, Month 2, …)** | The freight rate (usually in USD/MT) applicable for each month displayed. The table can show several consecutive months so you can see historical or forward‑looking price trends. |\n| **Dataset** | Indicates which data source the row belongs to (e.g., *Daily Freight Rates (DNEXR)*). Selecting the correct dataset ensures you are viewing the intended version of the rates (official vs. simulation). |\n| **Batch** | Groups rows that belong to the same analytical batch (e.g., a specific spot‑date run, client‑specific estimate, or shipment group). Filtering by batch narrows the view to a defined set of records. |\n| **Spot Date** | The market date for which the rates are valid (e.g., *2025‑11‑03*). Aligns the displayed rates with a particular day’s market conditions. |\n| **Load Port / Discharge Port** | The origin and destination ports for the cargo. Often shown as separate columns or combined in a “Load → Discharge” column. |\n| **Commodity** | The product being shipped (e.g., *Barley, Wheat, Corn*). Helps differentiate rates when multiple commodities share the same route. |\n| **Currency** | The currency in which the rate is expressed (typically **USD**). |\n| **Rate Type** | Indicates whether the value is a *spot* rate, *forward* rate, or *simulation* rate. |\n\n### How to Use the Column Definitions\n\n1. **Identify the record you need** – Use the filter icon on any column to narrow the view by vessel type, routing, spot date, etc.  \n2. **Interpret the rate values** – Look across the month columns to see how the price changes over time.  \n3. **Validate the context** – Check *Dataset*, *Batch*, and *Spot Date* columns to ensure the rates belong to the correct market scenario.  \n4. **Apply freight terms** – Understand the impact of the *Freight Terms* column on laytime calculations and overall cost.  \n\nThese definitions give you a clear picture of each data point in the Main Table, enabling accurate analysis and decision‑making within the Freight Rates module."
