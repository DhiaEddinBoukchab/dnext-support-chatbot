        "model_response": "**Configuring Port Terms in Freight Estimates**\n\nBelow is a complete, step‑by‑step guide to add or edit the freight terms that apply to a specific port (e.g., FIO rate, commission, payment terms) inside the **Freight Rates** module.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Dataset loaded** – the dataset that contains the vessels, routes and price tables must be selected in the top‑right **Dataset** dropdown.  \n2. **Batch selected** – you need an active batch (or create a new one) that will hold the estimate you are editing.  \n3. **Spot date set** – choose the appropriate spot date for the estimate; this determines which spot‑price tables are used.  \n4. **User rights** – you must have edit permission for the **Estimates** view.\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step Procedure\n\n| Step | Action | Details & Tips |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **1** | Open the **Freight Rates** module | Click the module icon from the Dnext dashboard. |\n| **2** | Navigate to **Estimates** | Use the top navigation bar → **Estimates** button (⚙️). |\n| **3** | Select the estimate you want to modify | In the Estimates list, locate the row (by vessel, voyage, or batch) and click **Edit** (pencil icon). |\n| **4** | Open the **Freight Configuration** panel | In the estimate view, click the **Freight Configuration** button (⚙️) located near the top‑right of the screen. |\n| **5** | Switch to the **Port Terms** tab | The configuration panel contains several tabs (General, Vessel, Port Terms, etc.). Choose **Port Terms**. |\n| **6** | Choose the port you are configuring | A drop‑down list of all ports on the itinerary appears. Select the target port (e.g., **Rotterdam**, **Houston**). |\n| **7** | Set the required freight terms | Fill in the fields that appear for the selected port: <br>• **FIO Rate (Pmt)** – contracted Free‑In/Out rate per metric ton.<br>• **Add Com %** – additional commission percentage applied to the freight.<br>• **Payment Terms** – e.g., **30 days net**, **LC at sight**, etc.<br>• **Port‑specific adjustments** – any surcharge or discount that is unique to the port. |\n| **8** | Validate the values | The module automatically recomputes **Gross Freight**, **Net Freight**, **Net Result**, and **Net TCE** as soon as you change any term. Verify that the numbers reflect the expected outcome. |\n| **9** | Save the configuration | Click **Apply** (or **Save**) at the bottom of the panel. A confirmation toast will appear. |\n| **10** | Re‑run the estimate (optional) | If you have bulk‑calculated estimates, you may need to trigger a **Re‑calculate** for the batch to propagate the new port terms to all related voyages. Use the **Bulk Calculate** button on the batch page. |\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them\n\n- **Missing Spot‑Date Data** – If the spot date does not have a matching price table, the freight terms will not affect the calculation. Always verify the spot‑date picker shows a valid date before editing.  \n- **Incorrect Commission Percentage** – The **Add Com %** field is applied to the **FIO Rate** *before* the final freight is calculated. A typo here can dramatically inflate or deflate the Net Freight. Double‑check the value (e.g., 2 % = `0.02`).  \n- **Port Not Listed** – Ports are generated from the **Itinerary** section. If a port is missing, add it first under **Itinerary → Port Status Options** and then return to the **Port Terms** tab.  \n- **Unsaved Changes** – The configuration panel does not auto‑save. Always click **Apply/Save**; otherwise the changes are lost when you leave the page.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference Cheat‑Sheet\n\n| Field | Description | Typical Format |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\n| **FIO Rate (Pmt)** | Contracted freight per metric ton | Numeric (e.g., `85.00`) |\n| **Add Com %** | Additional commission on freight | Decimal (e.g., `0.015` for 1.5 %) |\n| **Payment Terms** | Settlement conditions | Text (e.g., `30 days net`) |\n| **Port Surcharge/Discount** | Fixed amount added/subtracted from freight | Numeric (e.g., `‑2.5`) |\n\n---\n\n### What to Do If You Hit a Roadblock\n- **Data not updating** – Ensure you have refreshed the estimate after saving.  \n- **Port still missing** – Verify the port is present in the itinerary (see *Itinerary → Port Status Options*).  \n- **Error messages** – Capture the exact error text and forward it to support.\n\n**For any issues that cannot be resolved with the steps above, please contact support@dnext.io.**"

        "target_answer": "**Quantity Divisor** is a multiplier applied to values (e.g., 1000 to show thousands, 1000000 to show millions). It scales displayed data without affecting underlying calculations.",
        "model_response": "**Quantity Divisor** is the scaling factor applied to the raw trade‑quantity values that appear in a Trade Matrix.  \n\n- It **multiplies** the original numbers before they are displayed.  \n- The most common use is to set the divisor to **1000**, which converts quantities into “thousands” (e.g., a raw value of 2 500 000 MT will be shown as 2 500 × 1000 = 2 500 k MT).  \n- Adjusting the divisor lets you present data in a more readable unit (thousands, millions, etc.) without changing the underlying dataset.\n\n**When to use it**\n\n1. **Improve readability** – Large numbers become easier to scan in tables and charts.  \n2. **Match reporting standards** – If your organization reports trade volumes in thousands or millions, set the divisor accordingly.  \n3. **Consistent units** – Ensure all reporters and partners use the same divisor so totals and comparisons are accurate.\n\n**Typical setting**\n\n- In the **General Settings** form, you’ll see a field labeled **Quantity Divisor**.  \n- Enter **1000** to display values in thousands, **1 000 000** for millions, or **1** to show the raw figure.\n\n**Common pitfalls**\n\n- Forgetting to adjust the divisor after changing the **Unit** (e.g., switching from Metric Tons to Kilograms) can lead to misleading numbers.  \n- Using different divisors for different reporters within the same matrix will cause totals to be inconsistent; keep the divisor uniform across the matrix."

        "model_response": "**View Date** is the date‑range control that tells the Trade Matrix which periods (months, crop years, or quarters) should be displayed in the pivot table.  \nIt works like a filter for time – only data that falls inside the selected View Date range will appear, and any forecasts, intraflows or reference columns are limited to that window.\n\n---\n\n### What the setting does\n- **Limits the data shown** – rows/columns outside the range are hidden, so the table stays focused on the period you are analysing.  \n- **Controls forecast eligibility** – forecastable cells are only created for dates that are within the View Date range and that meet the finalisation rules.  \n- **Prevents “no data” errors** – if the range is set to a period for which no source dataset exists, the pivot will return empty cells.\n\n---\n\n### How to view / change the View Date range  \n\n1. **Open the View Settings panel**  \n   - Click the **gear (⚙️) icon** labelled **View Settings** at the top of the screen.  \n\n2. **Locate the Date tab** (the third tab in the panel)  \n   - The panel contains three tabs: **General Settings**, **Conversion Settings**, and **Decimal Settings**.  \n   - The **Date** (or **View Date**) controls are found on the **Decimal Settings** tab (the one that also lets you set decimal places).  \n\n3. **Adjust the range**  \n   - Choose the start and end **Month / Crop Year** you want to work with.  \n   - You can select a single month, a full crop‑year, or a custom range (e.g., Jan 2023 – Jun 2024).  \n\n4. **Apply the change**  \n   - Click **Save** or **Apply** at the bottom of the panel.  \n   - The pivot table refreshes and now shows data only for the selected dates.\n\n---\n\n### Common pitfalls & troubleshooting  \n\n| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| **Empty cells or “No data” message** | View Date range does not overlap with any available dataset. | Open **View Settings** and expand the range to include periods covered by your source datasets. |\n| **Forecast cells are not clickable** | Date range is set to a period that is already **finalized** (e.g., “Always Finalized”). | Change the range to a future period or adjust the finalisation rule in **Priority Rules** (set to “Never Finalized” or “Conditional”). |\n| **Intraflows or reference columns disappear** | The selected range excludes the months/years where those datasets exist. | Extend the View Date range to cover the months/years of the intraflow or reference data. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist before you start working with the matrix  \n\n- **Verify data availability** – go to **Configuration → Priority Rules** and confirm that the datasets you need contain data for the dates you plan to view.  \n- **Match mode** – ensure the matrix is in the correct mode (Export vs. Import) for the selected dates.  \n- **Refresh** – after changing the View Date, click the **Refresh Data** button (🔄) to pull the latest values.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** the **View Date** setting defines the temporal window of your trade matrix. Adjust it via the View Settings gear icon to include the months, crop years, or quarters you need, and always make sure the range aligns with the periods covered by your source datasets.  \n\nIf you still cannot see the expected data after checking the above, please contact **support@dnext.io**."

        "model_response": "**Bulk Calculate** is a feature in the Net Freight Rates module that lets you re‑run freight‑rate calculations for many estimates at once, without opening each estimate individually.\n\n### What it does\n- **Re‑calculates** freight values for a selected set of batches (or for all batches that are not currently running if no batch is chosen).  \n- Queues the recalculations as background jobs, so you can continue working while the runs progress.  \n- Updates each batch’s status and timestamps as the runs complete, giving you a clear view of success or failure.\n\n### When to use it\n- After you have changed market datasets, month‑factor settings, or other configuration that affects many estimates.  \n- When you need to produce a repeatable analysis trail (record the VC/TC datasets and month‑factor values used).  \n- To apply a new pricing logic (e.g., different **Current‑Month** or **Near‑Month** factors) across a whole client, date range, or shipment group.\n\n### How to run Bulk Calculate\n1. **Select a batch** (optional).  \n   - If you leave the batch field empty, the action will target *all* batches that are not currently running.  \n2. Click **Bulk Calculate** → a dialog appears with run parameters.  \n3. **Set the parameters**:  \n   - **VC Dataset** – dataset for virtual/visible calculations.  \n   - **TC Dataset** – dataset for test/time‑charter output (or configured TC target).  \n   - **Spot Dates** – one or more dates that will be used as the pricing position for every estimate in scope.  \n   - **Current‑Month Factor (%)** – factor applied to the current‑month pricing logic.  \n   - **Near‑Month Factor (%)** – factor applied to the next‑month forward logic.  \n   - **Execution Type** – choose **Daily** (run using each spot date’s daily settings) or **Friday** (run using end‑of‑week pricing cadence).  \n4. **Submit** the dialog. The system queues the recalculations.  \n5. **Monitor** batch status and the “last run” timestamps. If any run fails, inspect the individual estimate’s **Changes/Logs** for details.\n\n### Operational tips\n- **Pre‑flight checks**: Verify that your Freight Configuration datasets and priority rules are up‑to‑date before launching a bulk run.  \n- **Scope carefully**: Use batch filters (client, creator, date, etc.) to limit the run to only the estimates you intend to recalculate.  \n- **Record parameters**: Keep a note of the VC/TC datasets and month‑factor values used; this makes the analysis reproducible.  \n- **Troubleshooting**: If a run fails, check the estimate’s log for missing data, incorrect spot dates, or dataset mismatches.\n\nIn short, Bulk Calculate is the fast, centralized way to re‑price large groups of freight estimates, applying consistent market data and pricing factors while providing full visibility into run progress and results."

It displays every freight record that matches the selected dataset, batch, and spot‑date filters.\n\n- **One row per freight line** – e.g., *Barley | Constanta → Cai Mep*, *Soybean | Houston → Rotterdam*, etc.  \n- **Columns** show the key attributes of each record, such as:\n  - Commodity  \n  - Origin & Destination ports (routing)  \n  - Vessel type / class  \n  - Freight terms (e.g., FOB, CIF)  \n  - Rate values for the current spot month and any additional months you have enabled (Nov, Dec, etc.)  \n  - Any custom or calculated fields you have added via the configuration panel  \n\nThe table is fully interactive:\n\n1. **Search bar** – type any keyword (commodity, port, vessel) to instantly narrow the rows.  \n2. **Column filters** – click the filter icon on a column header to apply precise criteria.  \n3. **Sorting** – click a column header to sort ascending/descending.  \n4. **Batch selector** – choosing a batch limits the rows to rates that belong to that batch only.  \n\nIn short, the Main Table is the primary view where you **explore, filter, and analyze freight rates** before creating estimates or running batch calculations."

        "question": "What are Column Definitions in Main Table?",
        "target_answer": "Columns include: **Commodity 1/2**, **Vessel**, **Intake MT**, **Load/Discharge ports**, **Routing**, **Origin**, **L. Rate/D. Rate**, **L. Term/D. Term**, **Spot/Forward columns**.",
        "model_response": "**Column Definitions in the Main Table**\n\nThe Main Table in the Freight Rates module displays one row per freight record (e.g., *Barley – Constanta → Cai Mep*). Each column provides a specific piece of information that helps you analyse and compare rates. Below are the most common columns and what they represent:\n\n| Column | Definition |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Vessel Type** | The class of vessel used for the shipment (e.g., *Panamax, Supramax, Capesize*). Determines capacity, speed, and cost structure. |\n| **Routing** | The maritime corridor the vessel follows between the load and discharge ports (e.g., *Suez, Good Hope*). Different routes affect voyage duration and price. |\n| **Freight Terms** | Contractual terms that modify how laytime is counted (e.g., **SHEX** – Sundays & holidays excluded, **FHEX** – Fridays & holidays excluded, **SHINC** – includes loading/discharging time). |\n| **Rate Values (Month 1, Month 2, …)** | The freight rate (usually in USD/MT) applicable for each month displayed. The table can show several consecutive months so you can see historical or forward‑looking price trends. |\n| **Dataset** | Indicates which data source the row belongs to (e.g., *Daily Freight Rates (DNEXR)*). Selecting the correct dataset ensures you are viewing the intended version of the rates (official vs. simulation). |\n| **Batch** | Groups rows that belong to the same analytical batch (e.g., a specific spot‑date run, client‑specific estimate, or shipment group). Filtering by batch narrows the view to a defined set of records. |\n| **Spot Date** | The market date for which the rates are valid (e.g., *2025‑11‑03*). Aligns the displayed rates with a particular day’s market conditions. |\n| **Load Port / Discharge Port** | The origin and destination ports for the cargo. Often shown as separate columns or combined in a “Load → Discharge” column. |\n| **Commodity** | The product being shipped (e.g., *Barley, Wheat, Corn*). Helps differentiate rates when multiple commodities share the same route. |\n| **Currency** | The currency in which the rate is expressed (typically **USD**). |\n| **Rate Type** | Indicates whether the value is a *spot* rate, *forward* rate, or *simulation* rate. |\n\n### How to Use the Column Definitions\n\n1. **Identify the record you need** – Use the filter icon on any column to narrow the view by vessel type, routing, spot date, etc.  \n2. **Interpret the rate values** – Look across the month columns to see how the price changes over time.  \n3. **Validate the context** – Check *Dataset*, *Batch*, and *Spot Date* columns to ensure the rates belong to the correct market scenario.  \n4. **Apply freight terms** – Understand the impact of the *Freight Terms* column on laytime calculations and overall cost.  \n\nThese definitions give you a clear picture of each data point in the Main Table, enabling accurate analysis and decision‑making within the Freight Rates module."
