        "question": "Why is my Bulk Calculate operation failing?",
        "target_answer": "Try: 1) **Reduce batch size** – process fewer batches at once, 2) **Verify datasets** – ensure VC and TC datasets exist and are accessible, 3) **Check individual estimates** – calculate batches one by one to identify problematic estimates, 4) **Review estimate inputs** – ensure all have valid configurations.",
        "model_response": "**Why Your Bulk Calculate Is Failing**\n\nThe Bulk Calculate feature can fail for several reasons that are usually easy to resolve. Follow the checklist below to pinpoint the cause and get the operation running again.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Verify the Input Parameters  \n\n| Parameter | What to check |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **VC / TC Datasets** | Both datasets must exist, be active, and be accessible to your user role. |\n| **Spot Dates** | The selected spot dates need market data for the forward months you are calculating. |\n| **Month Factors** | Ensure the Current‑Month and Near‑Month factors are set (they can be 0 if you don’t want a multiplier). |\n| **Execution Type** | Choose the correct cadence (Daily or Friday) for the dates you supplied. |\n\n*If any of these are missing or point to an empty dataset, the run will abort.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reduce the Batch Size  \n\nBulk runs that include many batches often hit time‑outs.\n\n1. **Open the batch filter panel.**  \n2. **Select a smaller subset** (e.g., 5‑10 batches).  \n3. **Run Bulk Calculate** again.  \n\nIf the reduced set succeeds, the original failure was due to size. You can then:\n\n- Split the full list into several smaller runs, **or**  \n- Increase the server‑side timeout (requires admin assistance).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Process Batches Sequentially  \n\nRunning all batches in parallel can expose a single problematic estimate that stops the whole job.\n\n1. **Deselect “All Batches”.**  \n2. **Pick one batch** and start Bulk Calculate.  \n3. **Inspect the result** – if it succeeds, move to the next batch.  \n\nWhen a batch fails, open the **Changes/Logs** tab of the offending estimate to see the exact error (e.g., missing vessel data, invalid port‑term, or absent market rates).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Confirm Market Data Availability  \n\n- **Spot Date** – Verify that the spot date you chose actually has published rates. Try a different recent date as a sanity check.  \n- **Forward Months** – Some forward months may not yet be released; the calculation will stop if it can’t find rates for those months.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Check Your Network  \n\nA stable connection is required while the system queues and processes the calculations.\n\n- Use a wired connection or a reliable Wi‑Fi network.  \n- Avoid heavy bandwidth activities (large file downloads, video streaming) during the run.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Pre‑flight Checklist (Run Before Every Bulk Calculate)\n\n1. **Freight Configuration** – Ensure all required datasets are up‑to‑date and priority rules are correct.  \n2. **Estimate Inputs** – Verify vessel profile, itinerary, and port terms for every estimate in scope.  \n3. **Batch Filters** – Apply precise filters (client, creator, date) so you only target the intended records.  \n4. **Clear Stale Filters** – Reset any leftover UI filters that might hide data.  \n\nRunning this quick audit prevents most failures.\n\n---\n\n### 7. If the Problem Persists  \n\n- **Identify the failing estimate** via its **Changes/Logs** entry and correct the specific data issue (e.g., missing bunker price, invalid port compatibility).  \n- **Contact support** with the batch IDs, selected datasets, spot dates, and any error messages you see in the logs.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Recap**\n\n- ✅ Verify VC/TC datasets and spot dates.  \n- ✅ Reduce batch size or run batches one‑by‑one.  \n- ✅ Ensure market data exists for all forward months.  \n- ✅ Keep a stable internet connection.  \n- ✅ Perform the pre‑flight checklist before each run.\n\nFollowing these steps should resolve the majority of Bulk Calculate failures. If you still encounter issues after trying the above, please reach out to **support@dnext.io** with the details of your run."

        "model_response": "**Creating a Custom Tab in Production View**\n\nYou can save a specific combination of filters, settings, and conversions as a custom tab. The tab is stored locally in your browser, so it will be available each time you open that production.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n- You are already inside a **Production** (the view that shows the SND items).\n- The production you want to work with has been opened and the data grid is visible.\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step Guide\n\n1. **Set up the view you want to save**  \n   - Apply the required **Data Filters** (Origin, Product, Crop Year, etc.).  \n   - Adjust any **View Settings** you need (zoom, conversion factors, decimal places).  \n   - Collapse/expand regions or hide/show columns as desired.\n\n2. **Locate the Tab bar**  \n   - It is in the **top‑left corner** of the screen, next to the production name.\n\n3. **Create the custom tab**  \n   - Click the **“+” button** on the right side of the existing tabs.  \n   - A small dialog appears prompting you to name the tab.  \n   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., *“Americas‑Yield‑2024”*) and confirm.\n\n4. **Verify the tab**  \n   - The new tab appears alongside the default SND‑item tabs.  \n   - Click it to ensure the view restores exactly the filters and settings you configured.\n\n5. **Use the custom tab later**  \n   - Whenever you open this production, simply click the custom tab to switch instantly to the saved view.  \n   - The tab persists across browser sessions as long as you use the same browser profile.\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls & Tips\n\n- **Browser clearing** – If you clear browser cache or use a different browser/computer, the custom tab will disappear because it is stored locally. Consider bookmarking the production URL as a backup.\n- **Naming collisions** – Two tabs with the same name will overwrite each other. Use unique, descriptive names.\n- **Changing filters after saving** – If you modify filters while the custom tab is active, those changes are **not** saved automatically. Re‑open the tab or re‑save it if you need the new configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Result:** You now have a custom tab that instantly restores your preferred combination of filters, conversions, and display settings, speeding up repetitive analysis tasks in the Production view."

        "model_response": "**Setting Conditional Finalization – Publication Date**\n\nYou can lock a dataset so that its values become read‑only automatically once the official publication date is reached. Follow the steps below for each reporter/dataset that requires this rule.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Access the Production (or Trade Matrix) you are editing.**  \n2. **Be in *Priority Rules* view** – this is where finalization settings are defined.  \n3. **Know the dataset you want to lock** (e.g., USDA NASS Corn Area, USA Census Export Data, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step Configuration\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| **1** | Open the production (or trade matrix) and click **Configuration** → **Priority Rules**. |\n| **2** | Locate the **reporter** (country/region) you are working on. If the reporter is missing, add it first – otherwise the data will not appear in view mode. |\n| **3** | In the reporter’s row, find the **dataset** you want to finalize conditionally. Drag it into the **SND (Benchmark) section** if it isn’t already there. |\n| **4** | Click the **Finalization** dropdown for that dataset. |\n| **5** | Choose **“Conditional – Publication Date”**. |\n| **6** | (Optional) Verify the **Publication Date** field is populated in the source dataset metadata.

Always verify the reporter exists first.  \n- **Dataset Lacks Publication Date** – The conditional rule only works when the source dataset includes a valid publication date. Check the dataset’s metadata or contact the data provider if the date is absent.  \n- **Saving Before Clicking “Done”** – Changes in the Priority Rules page are not persisted until you press **Done** and then **Save Production**.  \n- **Overriding with “Always Finalized”** – Ensure you haven’t previously set the same dataset to **Always Finalized**, which would prevent the conditional rule from taking effect.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap\n\n1. **Configuration → Priority Rules**  \n2. Add/verify reporter & dataset.  \n3. Set **Finalization = Conditional – Publication Date**.  \n4. **Done → Save Production**.  \n\nAfter these steps, the platform will automatically lock the data once the official publication date arrives, giving you a reliable “finalized” state without manual intervention.  \n\nIf you encounter any issues not covered here, please reach out to **support@dnext.io**."

The pivot table will refresh, showing only cross‑border flows. |\n| **5** | **Validate the view** | • Scan the pivot table – there should be no rows where the reporter and partner are the same country. <br>• If any intraflow rows remain, repeat steps 2‑4 to ensure they are correctly defined as intraflows. |\n| **6** | **Export the CSV** | • Click the **Export** (down‑arrow) button in the toolbar. <br>• Choose **“Download CSV”**. <br>• The file that is generated reflects the current view, i.e., **without intraflows**. |\n| **7** | **Confirm the download** | Open the CSV in Excel/Sheets and verify that no reporter‑partner pairs are identical. |\n\n---\n\n### Common pitfalls & how to avoid them\n\n- **Intraflows still appear after export** – Make sure the **Intraflows toggle** is turned off *after* you have saved the intraflow definitions. The view must be refreshed before exporting.\n- **Missing data** – If turning off intraflows also hides data you need, double‑check that those pairs are not mistakenly classified as intraflows.\n- **Permission error** – Only users with **Edit Settings** rights can modify intraflow definitions. If the Settings button is disabled, request the appropriate role from your admin.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference (UI screenshot description)\n\n1. **Settings gear** → **Intraflows** list.  \n2. **Data Filters** → **Intraflows** checkbox (unchecked).  \n3. **Export** → **Download CSV**.\n\n---\n\nIf you prefer an API‑based download, the platform currently only exposes the **`download_tradeflow`** helper for TradeFlow objects, not for Trade Matrix exports. Therefore the reliable method is the UI workflow described above.\n\n---\n\n**Need further assistance?**  \nFor any issues not covered here (e.g., permission problems, unexpected data), please contact **support@dnext.io**."

        "model_response": "**Why Your Freight‑Rates Filters Appear to Do Nothing**\n\nWhen a filter is applied but the table still shows the same rows, the most common causes are:\n\n| Potential cause | What to check / fix |\n|-----------------|----------------------|\n| **Filters are still active from a previous session** | Use the **filter reset button** (usually a small “x” or “Clear All” icon) to remove every active filter, then re‑apply the one you need. |\n| **Filter text does not match the data exactly** | Filters are **case‑sensitive** in several columns. Verify the spelling, spacing and capitalisation of the value you type (e.g., “Soybean” vs “soybean”). |\n| **Multiple filters are being combined incorrectly** | Filters work as **AND** conditions – every filter must match a row. If you add a second filter that has no overlapping rows, the result will be empty (or appear unchanged). Test each filter **one at a time** to confirm it works before stacking them. |\n| **Spot‑date or dataset has no data** | The table only shows rates that exist for the selected **Spot Date** and **Dataset**. If the chosen date has no market data, the filter engine has nothing to narrow down. Try a different spot date or switch to a dataset you know contains data. |\n| **A batch is locked in** | If a **Batch** is selected, only rates from that batch are displayed, which can make a filter seem ineffective. Clear the batch selection to return to the full view. |\n| **Browser cache or stale UI state** | Occasionally the UI keeps an old filter state. Click the **Refresh** button on the table (or press **F5 / Ctrl‑R**) and, if the problem persists, clear the browser cache and reload the page. |\n| **Network hiccup while applying the filter** | A momentary loss of connectivity can prevent the filter request from reaching the server. Verify your internet connection and try again. |\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step Troubleshooting Guide\n\n1. **Reset the filter panel**  \n   - Click the **Filters** button (top‑right of the table).  \n   - Press the **Clear All** (or “reset”) icon.  \n   - Confirm that the table returns to its unfiltered state.\n\n2. **Confirm dataset & spot date**  \n   - Open the **Spot Date Picker** and choose a date you know has market data (e.g., a recent business day).  \n   - Verify that a valid **Dataset** is selected in the configuration bar.  \n\n3. **Apply a single, simple filter**  \n   - In the filter row of the column you want (e.g., *Commodity*), type the exact value **including correct case** (e.g., `Soybean`).  \n   - Press **Enter** or click the apply icon.  \n   - The table should instantly shrink to matching rows.\n\n4. **Test additional filters one at a time**  \n   - Add a second filter only after the first one works.  \n   - Remember that both conditions must be true for a row to appear.  \n\n5. **Refresh the data view**  \n   - Click the **Refresh** button (usually a circular arrow near the table header).  \n   - If the UI still looks wrong, press **Ctrl + F5** (or **Cmd + Shift + R**) to force a full page reload.\n\n6. **Clear browser cache if needed**  \n   - Open your browser’s settings → **Privacy & Security** → **Clear browsing data** → select **Cached images and files** → **Clear**.  \n   - Reload the Freight Rates module and repeat steps 1‑4.\n\n7. **Check network stability**  \n   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection while applying filters.  \n   - If you notice timeouts or “failed to load” messages, resolve the network issue before retrying.\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Using partial or miss‑spelled values** – the filter will be ignored.  \n- **Assuming filters are OR logic** – they are AND; all conditions must be satisfied.  \n- **Leaving a batch selected** – it limits the data set and can mask filter effects.  \n- **Applying filters before the spot‑date data loads** – wait for the table to finish loading (spinner disappears) before typing filter criteria.  \n\n---\n\nIf you have followed the steps above and the filters still do not behave as expected, there may be a deeper configuration issue (e.g., missing input datasets in Freight Configuration) or a system‑wide bug. In that case, please reach out to the support team with:\n\n- Your user ID  \n- The spot date and dataset you are using  \n- Screenshots of the filter panel and the table view  \n\n**Contact:** support@dnext.io  \n\nThey will investigate the logs and provide a targeted fix."

        "model_response": "**Vessel draft is a key driver of the intake calculation for each port call.**  \n\nWhen you open the **Intake** tab the system shows two read‑only results:\n\n| Field | What it shows | How draft is used |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Calculated intake (MT)** | The tonnage the model expects the vessel to take on at this stop. | The value is **derived** from the vessel’s current draft together with the port’s zone constraints and the vessel‑configuration settings. |\n| **Maximum allowable intake (MT)** | The upper limit that the port permits for this call. | It is computed from **local draft/berth limits** and other vessel characteristics (e.g., length, LOA, draft‑dependent depth restrictions). |\n\n### How draft influences the numbers\n\n1. **Draft‑based depth checks** – The system compares the vessel’s draft (including ballast, cargo, and any under‑keel clearance) against the port’s depth profile for the selected zone.  \n2. **Zone constraints** – Some ports have multiple draft zones (e.g., shallow vs. deep). The draft determines which zone the vessel can use, and each zone has its own intake ceiling.  \n3. **Berth limits** – If the draft exceeds the berth’s permissible draft, the **Maximum allowable intake** is reduced to keep the vessel within safe limits.  \n4. **Configuration rules** – Vessel‑specific rules (e.g., draft‑dependent cargo density limits) are applied automatically, further shaping the **Calculated intake**.\n\n### Practical impact\n\n- **Higher draft** → tighter depth/berth restrictions → lower **Maximum allowable intake** → the model may suggest a reduced cargo load to stay within safe limits.  \n- **Lower draft** (e.g., after ballast discharge) → more depth margin → higher possible intake, allowing the model to allocate more cargo tonnage.\n\n### Quick check workflow\n\n1. **Enter/verify vessel draft** in the itinerary or vessel profile.  \n2. Navigate to the **Intake** tab.  \n3. Review the **Calculated intake** and **Maximum allowable intake** values.  \n4. If the calculated intake exceeds the maximum, adjust the draft (e.g., by planning ballast off‑loading) or select a different port zone to achieve the desired cargo load.\n\n**Bottom line:** Draft determines the depth and berth constraints that the system uses to compute both the *allowable* and *actual* intake tonnage for a port stop. Adjusting draft directly changes those intake results."

In the Trade Matrix module, reporters represent the **exporting side** (when the matrix is in *Export* mode) or the **importing side** (when the matrix is in *Import* mode). They are the “source” nodes of the trade network that you select and organize in the **Reporters** panel when building a matrix.\n\nKey points:\n\n- **Origin of shipments** – the quantities shown in the matrix are recorded as moving **from** the reporter **to** the selected partners (destinations).  \n- **Selection & grouping** – you pick reporters from the left‑hand list, move them to the right‑hand list, and can organize them into folders (e.g., “Americas”, “Europe”) for easier navigation.  \n- **Special settings** – a reporter can be marked as **Unreported** (data estimated/forecasted) or used in **Intraflow** definitions (trade between two reporters within the same matrix).  \n- **Typical examples** – United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, Argentina, etc.\n\nIn short, a Reporter is the **originating entity** whose trade data you want to analyze, compare, and forecast within the Trade Matrix."
